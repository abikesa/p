# 1. Received two emails 
- patrickmuinda@gmail.com
- muinda@yahoo.com
- `Ambiguity` and a little confusion as to whether they were duplicates
- Some sort of warning to expect two seperate communications would help
- Wasn't expecting in emails from you regarding an "expert review"
- Didn't know i was an expert :)

# 2. First email
- Was about expert validation of digital transformation model developed using PLS-SEM
- Since I was at work, I thought I'll study this in the evening or over the weekend

# 3. Second email
- Dear reviewer, ...
- Because the first email called me an expert and this one a reviewer my confusion was sustained
- Email says there's an attached PPT for expert validation
- For a second I was wondering what PPT stands for (I'm transitioned away from office suite)
- Would help to be warned not only about the two emails but also about how long this process might take of our time
- Assure me also that I'm an expert and can review otherwise I feel like an imposter

# 4. Downloaded PPT
- Converted to .PDF
- Realized its 30 pages
- Quick review tells me some slides have way too much info
- Usually a readable slide has about 3 bullet points in 24 size font
- My personal preference is for `plain white slides` that do not distract
- Since the slides have a lot of content I know I don't have time to review during work hours
- And so I'm going to upload .PDF to GPT-4 and see if it can summarize
- Will also include the email verbiage you sent
