# 1. Received two emails 
- patrickmuinda@gmail.com
- muinda@yahoo.com
- `Ambiguity` and a little confusion as to whether they were duplicates
- Some sort of warning to expect two seperate communications would help
- Wasn't expecting in emails from you regarding an "expert review"
- Didn't know i was an expert :)

# 2. First email
- Was about expert validation of digital transformation model developed using PLS-SEM
- Since I was at work, I thought I'll study this in the evening or over the weekend

# 3. Second email
- Dear reviewer, ...
- Because the first email called me an expert and this one a reviewer my confusion was sustained
- Email says there's an attached PPT for expert validation
- For a second I was wondering what PPT stands for (I'm transitioned away from office suite)
- Would help to be warned not only about the two emails but also about how long this process might take of our time
- Assure me also that I'm an expert and can review otherwise I feel like an imposter

# 4. Downloaded PPT
- Converted to .PDF
- Realized its 30 pages
- Quick review tells me some slides have way too much info
- Usually a readable slide has about 3 bullet points in 24 size font
- My personal preference is for `plain white slides` that do not distract
- Since the slides have a lot of content I know I don't have time to review during work hours
- And so I'm going to upload .PDF to GPT-4 and see if it can summarize
- Will also include the email verbiage you sent

# 5. GPTs summary
- Now I've a sense of the entire powerpoint
- So next is Google documents

# 6. Expert validation
- There's a lot of verbiage in the "Fill out in google forms" email
- But I see I hyperlink and click on it (not sure if I'm missing important stuff)
- Led to a login page and so I guess I should create some form of account

# 7. Signup
- Took me less than a minute
- I see "My Projects":
    - Test
    - TVET IT Process Management
    - TVET Digital Transformation Project
    - Digital analytics
- Not sure which one to click on
- My guess? Test!
- Ok, looks like I need to go back to the email
- I'm lost

# 8. Email instructions
- At bottom of the email is "continue"
- So I click on it
- Now I'm at a page titled: Expert Validation of Digital Transformation Model (SDTP) Developed using PLS-SEM
- Looks like I need a gmail address to accomplish this (Warn other users)
- I have one and I login
- Confusing, that I'm logged in (shows my gmail, but also asks me to spell out my email address)
- Ah, ok, now I'm being asked about my background info as correspondent
- Highest level of education says "PhD", but it should be "doctorate"
- I'm a medical doctor but with no PhD. I'd be under "Doctorate"

# 9. Questionnaire
- Going smoothly
- But there should be "Other" sections in the drop-down menu
- Also I'm being asked about the "Simulator"
- No clue the sequence of events I'm supposed to follow after the two emails

# 10 Simulator
- Now I'm doing the simular so that I can complete the questionnaire items
- But wait? Is that the other "thing" I logged into with Test, TVET etc?
- Confused
- There's a dashboard with places to be filled including task programmability, communication, etc
- I think I'm lost
- Call big brother
