   - Digital transformation projects are...
      - Failure rate of 70%
      - Existential risk for organizations (NITA?)
      - Venture vs. Project (`How about also Management vs. Governance?`)
   - Absence of progress in low income countries might be ...
      - Criteria for success (aka `checklist`: mentions in literature)
         - Performance (93%):
            - XX `was` achieved 
         - Efficiency (93%):
            - It `cost XX% less` than was budgeted 
            - It `lasted XX% shorter` than projected
        ---
         - Change (43%):
            - Project `achieved` intended outcome
            - However, it `disrupted` traditional values
            - Principal should `revisit` these values
         - Growth (29%):
            - Project `challenged` members
            - Theirs skills were `improved` by these challenges
            - Many team members have `developed` in the process
         - Termination (14%):
            - New problems `don't appear` after completion
              - I think this is an outcome
              - Can't be a criterion for success
              - Such should be defined `before` initiation and perhaps observed `during` implementation
              - But not `after` completion; anything after is an outcome
         - Innovation (14%):
            - We `identified` this list of problems
            - XX `solved` 60% of them
            - XX `remain` unsolved
         - Demand (43%):
            - Project `developed` XX
            - Organizations `use` XX
            - We will `sell` XX to Organizations 
   - The central thesis is that ...
