# A. Title
   - A framework for digital transformation in technical, vocation education and training institutions in UGanda

# B. Definitions
   - TVET
   - IBDM
   - GDP
   - etc.

# C. ToC
   - Introduction
   - Literature
   - Methods
   - Results
     - Focus Group
     - Survey Findings
   - Discussion
     - Summary of findings
     - Knowledge gap filled
     - Strength/Limitations 
     - Conclusions: Design of `SDTP`
        - SDTP should be spelled out
        - Absolutely `0% fun` in going to and forth to the super-long list of `alien acronyms`


# D. Lists
   - Figures
   - Tables
   - `Acronyms`
      - Place unbearable burden to recall on reader!
      - No place for them in digital age
      - Costs of publication no longer in terms of `number of characters` in document
      - In fact cost of publication is zero in 2023
      - As a reader and writer, I do away entirely with acronyms; they don't help anyone at all!

# E. Abstract
   - Backround
   - Methods
   - Results
   - Conclusions

# 1. Introduction

       1.Failure
                \
3.Checklist ->   2.Agent -> 5.Mitigation -> 6.Success
                /
                4.Principal

# 2. Literature

```
    1.Processes/COBIT
                     \
3.Checklist/Audit ->  2.Tools/Control -> 5.Management -> 6.Relationships/Governance

                      4.Structures
```

   - Digital transformation projects are...
      - Failure rate of 70%
      - Existential risk for organizations (NITA?)
      - Venture vs. Project (`How about also Management vs. Governance?`)
   - Absence of progress in low income countries might be ...
      - Criteria for success (aka `checklist`: mentions in literature)
         - Performance (93%):
            - XX `was` achieved 
         - Efficiency (93%):
            - It `cost XX% less` than was budgeted 
            - It `lasted XX% shorter` than projected
        ---
         - Change (43%):
            - Project `achieved` intended outcome
            - However, it `disrupted` traditional values
            - Principal should `revisit` these values
         - Growth (29%):
            - Project `challenged` members
            - Theirs skills were `improved` by these challenges
            - Many team members have `developed` in the process
         - Termination (14%):
            - New problems `don't appear` after completion
              - I think this is an outcome
              - Can't be a criterion for success
              - Such should be defined `before` initiation and perhaps observed `during` implementation
              - But not `after` completion; anything after is an outcome
         - Innovation (14%):
            - We `identified` this list of problems
            - XX `solved` 60% of them
            - XX `remain` unsolved
         - Demand (43%):
            - Project `developed` XX
            - Organizations `use` XX
            - We will `sell` XX to Organizations 
   - The central thesis is that ...

   - Success
      - Are these the various `checklists` in the literature?
      - If so I'd personally use this language to invite non-IT people
      - COBIT, Prince2, ISO, etc are `uninviting`, ugly names, for an outsider 
   - COBIT
   - Prince2
   - ISO
   - NITA
      - `MDA` acronym on page 74
      - No clue what is means
      - Too lazy to "go back" to section on acronyms
      - Wouldn't cost zero to just spell it out here 
   - Etc.
   - `Agency theory`
      - Is this one of the "checklists" or does it compete with these other systems?
      - You choose this over the other options but I didn't get that in the title, abstract, or introduction
      - Why agency theory? It should be super clear by end of abstract!
    - There are wayyy too many frameworks
       - I personally completely lost track with the endless subsections (2.4, 2.9, etc) & tables
       - Perhaps have some larger framework to summarize them
       - You used a table (which isn't visual)
       - We the outsiders need a `figure` to simplify, visualize EVERYTHING in one place
       - Fig 2.14
          - Difficult to follow
          - `Wayyyy tooo many` hypotheses (H1-H7) & sub-hypotheses (a-d) (this is on top of the COBIT, Prince2, etc frameworks)
          - Just too much for anyone on the planet to consume
          - Need to filter ideas down to something simpler for outsiders (e.g., for your mother)
          - If you succeed with us outsiders, imagine how much success you'll have with insiders!!!

## 3.6 Change
   - Failure
   - Intervention
   - Success

*There are too many diagrams, figures, and frameworks and I personally am not able to keep up with them. One solution is to have a simple framework (I've shared variations of such a framework in the flowcharts above) & keep building it from Chapter 1 to Chapter 7: add, remove, modify... but keep the reader anchored to something they are familiar with... annuŋŋamya*
