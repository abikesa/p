   - The Principle (GoU) would have been the agent
   - For lack of "agency", the principal hires an agent or manager
   - Agent manages the `project`, whose goal is to "implement" a digital tool or environment on behalf of ...
   - We may frame successful projects as those which check everything on some "checklist"

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.010
Most people.

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.500
Patrick Muinda: Yes.

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:12.540
Patrick Muinda: so. And and also the other is that I've been fortunate enough to have been in an environment which is academic. And the goal number one is publication.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.840
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.059
Abimereki Muzaale: So I've been publishing since 2,010.

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.129
Patrick Muinda: Oh, God.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.640
Abimereki Muzaale: having trouble sharing. Sharing my skin. Okay.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.809
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So this is now we're recording so just to reiterate that the title is the most seen.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.449
Abimereki Muzaale: Prove this, I'm speaking from intuition.

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:51.950
Abimereki Muzaale: By the abstract. Then the next scene by people of no time, including me, might do. What I'll do is the table. Take it, you know, while there's something called table, one specific meaning the population. Then the figures.

11
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.360
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

12
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.730
Abimereki Muzaale: those things should be able to tell that in past during that one, if the.

13
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.300
Abimereki Muzaale: And then

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:16.279
Abimereki Muzaale: in clinical journals there's a limit you can't write non stop. There's a wide limit. There may be limit to the number of tables and figures. So there is you. There's a deliberate

15
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.840
Abimereki Muzaale: in this effort to condense everything you have into limited space

16
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.570
Abimereki Muzaale: number of papers and number of figures.

17
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.659
Abimereki Muzaale: I like to tell my students, yeah.

18
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.040
Abimereki Muzaale: only table allowed

19
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.389
Abimereki Muzaale: is table one.

20
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:49.890
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Let me give you an example of table one. So this from my perspective, let me find my most cited paper.

21
00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:16.779
Abimereki Muzaale: it's table one look, look! This is makes me proud. 900 for citations, which is in feel as small as mine. Transfer surgeries. You have. 900 people have been cited, new one, cited, not red, but actually produced science. And for the paper relevant, it's a it's a second most cited paper in in the specific area of kiddie donation.

22
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.109
Patrick Muinda: How does someone achieve this?

23
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.010
Abimereki Muzaale: I know, because I produced the second and third, most cited the the tha, the sick, the most cited is

24
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.589
Abimereki Muzaale: let's see, is doing our mortality.

25
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.160
Abimereki Muzaale: and that's my first ever publication. It's this one. 7, 44,

26
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:48.159
Abimereki Muzaale: 7, 74. This is 2010, the others 2014. So I'll produce this. The the most cited is

27
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.150
Abimereki Muzaale: Ibrahim.

28
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.220
Abimereki Muzaale: Don't know consequences

29
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:09.750
Abimereki Muzaale: is this is the most cited one. So like stays from Minnesota. And so this I had 2 papers from us. So we critic the methods here. And so combined. We end up with

30
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.319
Abimereki Muzaale: one 900 plus 700. That's run 1,600 citations combined by inspiration.

31
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:40.980
Abimereki Muzaale: We inspired us because it was published in the most reputable journal called England Journal of Medicine. And the We're immediately we're like. This is, my method is wrong, and that's what expired. I work. Yeah. So now, look, this is the most famous, not the most cited paper in my specific area, but also the journal

32
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:50.260
Abimereki Muzaale: is called New England Journal of Medicine. It's the most. If if you get the average number of citations or papers per journal in medicine, that is

33
00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:04.699
Abimereki Muzaale: but medicine. Specifically, this is number one undisputed. It has an average of a paper published in this journal as an average of about 60 citations. 60. That's an average

34
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.909
Abimereki Muzaale: that's very high. So most journalists average is like 201.

35
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.749
Abimereki Muzaale: It's an average 60. And clearly, this one's in 1,010 site Admins is very special paper. Look at the length of the title.

36
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:30.520
Abimereki Muzaale: The journal limits. So so this is so le limits in medical journals, even you, when you're submitting your journal. Your articles.

37
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.430
Abimereki Muzaale: Cause I went down to your

38
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.149
Abimereki Muzaale: did so you had your thesis has. If this is has.

39
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.729
Abimereki Muzaale: Is this is this is this, is this is here.

40
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.220
Abimereki Muzaale: So you see. I have your up, your your. This is as a white document.

41
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.860
Abimereki Muzaale: and this. Pdf, you cannot see if you can't pre preview it. What document from Github you have to.

42
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.480
Abimereki Muzaale: So I created view. And you see that name project. We end up Phd, thesis. So if

43
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.939
Abimereki Muzaale: you have a new version, use exactly the same name, then you'll end up.

44
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.370
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So you don't need to be changing names.

45
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.829
Abimereki Muzaale: So So when I was going systematically, the way I review things stuff as an editor, I started here

46
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.690
Patrick Muinda: and I've seen this title for is it? What? 2 years now?

47
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:46.919
Abimereki Muzaale: And so this time I was like, I need to understand this title. Fine. II must understand it. And that process. That's what led me here. Then then, up to the title I went to abstract hope. I didn't miss this section. This is no part of the science.

48
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.969
Abimereki Muzaale: This is not the science. Wait a second. What is this?

49
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes.

50
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.330
Abimereki Muzaale: so I went here. I feel like I missed something.

51
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.379
Abimereki Muzaale: My name is the abstract. So so this is the next section I went to.

52
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.369
Patrick Muinda: I don't think I disrupted them.

53
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.679
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So after that struggle to the title, I was like what I phone that one thing missing. The title was

54
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.760
Abimereki Muzaale:  evolve.

55
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.159
Abimereki Muzaale: And then here, I think finally I find a verb. There's a verb here

56
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.590
Patrick Muinda: improve.

57
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.230
Abimereki Muzaale: but we'll get to that.

58
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:36.449
Abimereki Muzaale: But then abstract, so abstract. So number one title, the length of the title, don't worry about this. Yeah. Cause. II know the Phd, I mean, I don't think

59
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.850
Abimereki Muzaale: like 25.

60
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:51.379
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, it doesn't image. Okay. Now, way too generous. Yeah. So hmm. In the I in the from an artistic perspective.

61
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.120
Abimereki Muzaale: are

62
00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:14.090
Abimereki Muzaale: me as an I. Just when I think of artists, music, and for me, when I think of music, it's of course I think of my care cause that's when music was born in me. Thanks to you, I should mean to the world of music. Then I then I II went to Buddhism and moved personal guys from my carrier. But then it became another influence.

63
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.259
Abimereki Muzaale: and then I moved on. And one thing I find in music is that

64
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.530
there are rules composing.

65
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.650
Abimereki Muzaale: and most people must assume music. But if you're going to compose

66
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.430
Abimereki Muzaale: their rules.

67
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.839
Abimereki Muzaale: and the rules vary with genre.

68
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.559
Patrick Muinda: So if you're composing for gospel, if you're composing for

69
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.430
Abimereki Muzaale: a

70
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.039
Abimereki Muzaale: or rock, the rules are different. This is, that's what makes a genre. But then

71
00:07:45.150 --> 00:08:00.019
Abimereki Muzaale: I just have distinction at their own rules. And you're like, Oh, that sounds like this person. Yeah, that sounds like. So if a general limits you to if the pieces limits you to 25 once.

72
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.669
Abimereki Muzaale: must you?

73
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.520
We're like hold! Let me try my best to reach 25.

74
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.319
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, no, no! For me as an individual my limit is 10,

75
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:19.499
Abimereki Muzaale: and that becomes your style, and you force it on yourself. I can tell you. The more limits you give yourself the more beautiful things become

76
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:31.510
Abimereki Muzaale: because the person who is reading your stuff does not know how you are. Yeah stuff. But that's because you impose more rules on yourself.

77
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:40.070
Abimereki Muzaale: They this is someone by Mary, Mary called, put my shoppers off my feet so that I can dance. You know that. Yes, I do

78
00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:57.000
Abimereki Muzaale: from an African American perspective. It makes sense because it's it's in slavery war shop. So Nietzsche has an expression that says dancing in chains. Yeah.

79
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.530
Abimereki Muzaale: so much. Because I have this. I'm like Nietzsche saying, Oh.

80
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:14.919
Abimereki Muzaale: don't complain just because he's been enslaved. Yeah, actually, that's you can. Still, yeah. So if they've given you rules, that 25 words is maximum.

81
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.879
Abimereki Muzaale: you could be like, really. I'm going to make it 10

82
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:32.080
Abimereki Muzaale: and that's within those 10 ones. So that's something that. That is a key signature of art beautiful. And then I just said added rules to those that already exist.

83
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:45.549
Abimereki Muzaale: And so New England of medicine added rules. This I published in Jama, which is a number 3 more cited. That limits II don't know. It's kind of short

84
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:53.469
Abimereki Muzaale: but I don't know if it meets the required the standards of this journal. Yeah, this one is definitely shorter than this.

85
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.929
Abimereki Muzaale: but I prefer hot title

86
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:09.689
Abimereki Muzaale: but let me get into that detail. But that's one rule, then the abstract. Yeah, this channel the limit was 2 50 wise. So if you can't, 3, 50,

87
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.429
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. And they're structured this this section, some journals do not structure.

88
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.249
Abimereki Muzaale: They just upstream just bunch of ones. But even if they don't.

89
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.769
Abimereki Muzaale: even if they don't have the structure, it's implied.

90
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm! It's implied. And the most basic structure is this one the end of England.

91
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:40.790
Abimereki Muzaale: Let me see, it's background method results. Conclusion. So even if if if the journal is unstructured, you can remove these things and just leave the sentences there. That's structured.

92
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.690
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, it's still there. So if you look at the this is

93
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:58.130
Abimereki Muzaale: the first, most striking thing about your abstract is that it's not an abstract. It's too long. I didn't. I don't. I don't think that limits to an abstract in a thesis, are they? There? I don't think so.

94
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:06.709
Abimereki Muzaale: you know III haven't put any rules, but I just know a structure is what you have just mentioned

95
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.330
Abimereki Muzaale: is the structure required? I don't think so, is it?

96
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.490
Yeah, it is there.

97
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.969
Patrick Muinda: Oh, the structure is, yeah.

98
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.790
Patrick Muinda: just just as you said it. That's how it is.

99
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.659
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay. But you did not. Yeah. But it's not explicit.

100
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.129
Abimereki Muzaale: They you we're not required their background methods, right? But it's there. No.

101
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:46.040
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay? So so in a sense, unstructured in the sense that the actual white background methods, results and conclusions that not fair. But of course, that implies. So yeah, obviously, you're giving us the background

102
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:52.890
Abimereki Muzaale: absolutely. I can tell you, this is too long. Yeah.

103
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:59.879
Abimereki Muzaale: if even if there are no rules on the length of an abstract, it's too long, too long

104
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:10.089
Abimereki Muzaale: for me. This is this is my rule. As of, I think, 3 months ago, I will never even an email as something as simple as an email as long as professional.

105
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:18.099
Abimereki Muzaale: Do not mess up my content because you can't mess it up.

106
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.629
Patrick Muinda: But how do you tell is not use those very words?

107
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:36.319
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, II use those wise cause, II said, because mess up your stuff and because it produces. See, that is so beautiful it's language is so nice.  I can't copy and paste here. So let me download this

108
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.240
Abimereki Muzaale: cause it's in.

109
00:12:42.510 --> 00:13:03.329
Abimereki Muzaale: I have no idea I'm trying to. So I've just done. Let me just download it on a copy of based from here. So given me edited versions of myself in person. Later, I find it at least omitted so many things that I phone. Yeah, I'm like.

110
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:24.589
Abimereki Muzaale: so so yeah, so now it's good that you put it on enough experience. So now please don't mess with my content. That's what I said, Don't miss? Oh, yes, the more instructions give charge, if it's trained on

111
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.640
Abimereki Muzaale: 1.3 trillion, not what, but trillion parameters, what they're called tokens.

112
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:42.350
Abimereki Muzaale: So rules from you just 5 or 6 rules. That's nothing. So oh, yeah, it is. So here's what I'm going to do a

113
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:53.460
Abimereki Muzaale: so I would for me. II strongly recommend this charge. Gp is the sum total, not the average, the sum total of all human knowledge.

114
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Because Internet and if there's any human knowledge. That's another Internet. Probably it's not

115
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.800
Abimereki Muzaale: so. Okay, I've pasted this here. I'm going to say.

116
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey, please let me make this bigger.

117
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.420
Patrick Muinda: Please.

118
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.250
Abimereki Muzaale: Edit.

119
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.820
cool

120
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.350
Abimereki Muzaale: grammar and clarity.

121
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:26.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Do not mess with my content.

122
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.549
Patrick Muinda: Don't miss my credits.

123
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.589
Patrick Muinda: I didn't know you can say that.

124
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:39.480
Abimereki Muzaale: Look, there's no limits, so if you if you say, didn't, you means you created your own limits. What? Yeah, I need to do.

125
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.240
Patrick Muinda: Okay.

126
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.479
Abimereki Muzaale: I haven't told you. It's an abstract. I should. I forgot to tell you that.

127
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.780
Abimereki Muzaale: So it's it's giving me something long already. This is long is really too long.

128
00:14:52.050 --> 00:15:05.260
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, do you need to put it in again, or you can't give another command. I usually I in in the same session. It still has that memory, if you have changes. But but at times it forgets.

129
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.440
Abimereki Muzaale: To remind it.

130
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:15.389
Abimereki Muzaale: So this, yeah. okay, so so let's see, in today's rapidly changing global environment.

131
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.620
Abimereki Muzaale: A

132
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:24.799
Abimereki Muzaale: okay. So this, this has kept almost everything as it was, I'm sure any drama, and I do not know if any

133
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:34.950
Abimereki Muzaale: but so yeah, you took. So it doesn't change much here. The first sentence, the second one is took a relentless provenance to talk of a consistent rate

134
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.680
Abimereki Muzaale: the next step of conventional solutions. You talk of traditional solutions

135
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.320
Abimereki Muzaale: and realize it's over. So it doesn't change much.

136
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:50.499
Abimereki Muzaale: Realize, didn't hear you saying this study sets goals. So it's pretty much similar.

137
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.189
Abimereki Muzaale: But now let me say

138
00:15:53.470 --> 00:16:04.370
Abimereki Muzaale: thanks. but I forgot to mention. forgot to mention that this is the abstract.

139
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.559
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, a Phd. This is titled.

140
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.570
Abimereki Muzaale: the more detail, the more value

141
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.800
Patrick Muinda: definitely, okay.

142
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.200
Abimereki Muzaale: definitely, definitely.

143
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:25.530
Patrick Muinda: as being careful as trying, careful how not to confuse it, how not to confuse something trained on the entire Internet.

144
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.859
Abimereki Muzaale: No, that's not going to happen

145
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.919
Abimereki Muzaale: the more information, the more value. No worries.

146
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.490
Patrick Muinda: Hello

147
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.120
Abimereki Muzaale: given. It's an abstract. It should be concise. Have you seen that

148
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:50.049
Abimereki Muzaale: abstract? So so this link definitely does not qualify for an abstract, even if they don't give you limits? That's it's too long. That's point number one.

149
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.210
Abimereki Muzaale: let's see. That's it. 1, 2, 3, 4.

150
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.720
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, amazing. Let's see, let's yeah.

151
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.629
Abimereki Muzaale: In this global environment. Millie Milo's environment. French

152
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:17.200
Abimereki Muzaale: take tivid increasingly acknowledge the pivotal role of this in skill delivery. Despite this

153
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:27.280
Abimereki Muzaale: signing blah blah blah. 70% with financial waste is reaching 99 for every dollar invested.

154
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:32.070
Abimereki Muzaale: This prevalent issue. particularly pronouncing Uganda

155
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:42.189
Abimereki Muzaale: kind of largely be attributable to lack of robust it. Governance and inherent deficiencies so that that's a very big introduction, and I can tell you

156
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.180
Patrick Muinda: the way I tried everything.

157
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.470
Abimereki Muzaale: Exactly. So when I was

158
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.570
having trouble with

159
00:17:53.030 --> 00:18:01.599
Abimereki Muzaale: with A, with an abstract, with a title. Before abstract. I made some notes. I made some notes.

160
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.040
yes.

161
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.530
Abimereki Muzaale: and

162
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:13.139
Abimereki Muzaale: the thing about my notes that the things I was reading, when most of the questions, everything I was reading when was creating more questions instead of giving me answers.

163
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:20.929
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, because I could not visualize. I couldn't figure out who was doing what? To whom? Yeah.

164
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.210
Abimereki Muzaale: III gbt, I said, do you identify?

165
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.849
Patrick Muinda: That is the abstract structure?

166
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.520
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, no, no, I first instead of the title, then it was an obstruct

167
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:41.100
Abimereki Muzaale: something in the abstract which I was struggling with.

168
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:47.500
Patrick Muinda: I made too many comments, and I'm already confused about where they are.

169
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.149
Abimereki Muzaale: So it was an abstract

170
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.420
intro.

171
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.920
This is just taking this whole thing to a whole new level, I'm telling you.

172
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:07.900
Patrick Muinda: GGG. Pta, I'm still learning.

173
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:14.329
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, chargeably, I mean is, is really something.

174
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.830
Is this the thing?

175
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:25.130
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yes, yes. So this is your obstruct. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

176
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:33.339
Abimereki Muzaale: and this, this is the version it gave me last time. So they didn't get to what's just given today

177
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.770
Abimereki Muzaale: basis or more.

178
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:48.550
Abimereki Muzaale: So I asked Gbt, I think Gbt, to limit to 200 to 350 wise today I didn't tell it to limit those ones. But it didn't it? That, anyway.

179
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:55.310
Abimereki Muzaale: But what I wanted to show you was my comments. I don't know why I'm confused as to where those comments are.

180
00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.499
Patrick Muinda: the comments are in what you stand to me. It's actually what you shared with me.

181
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:08.130
Patrick Muinda: Yes, it's in the discussion. So I created a discussion this very one year.

182
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:16.669
Abimereki Muzaale: So that's correct, they're there. But I think I use a discussion for to to create links to the specific items.

183
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.870
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, let's see

184
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.200
Abimereki Muzaale: if I have a choice.

185
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.599
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay? So this I wanted the title. Maybe I didn't. I didn't record

186
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:37.630
Abimereki Muzaale: the title. Okay, I mean, I may be wasting your time?

187
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.370
because I'm just trying to get something very specific.

188
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:47.290
Abimereki Muzaale: II just wanted to. This is Tito. But it's this stuff. Oh, it's this.

189
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:56.620
Abimereki Muzaale: So. So I went. This is exactly how I do the general audio, because I already do title abstract introduction.

190
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.380
Patrick Muinda: Because reviewers have seen I've done that. They've read the whole paper, and I've given that.

191
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:09.639
Abimereki Muzaale: So I'm like, Okay, let me first, before I read the reviewers, let me just get a sense of the paper, and I see the title.

192
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:20.479
Abimereki Muzaale: and the title should the if the abstract is a summary of the paper in 200 words or 300 words. Then the title is a summary of the abstract

193
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.579
Abimereki Muzaale: in yeah, that's what it is.

194
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.860
Patrick Muinda: and the

195
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:50.280
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. So so the title. So the abstract is an abstract, an extraction of the essence and soul of the entire paper. Therefore, you can think of the title as an abstract and essential essence of the abstract. And in terms of Re, how much is read of your article on paper?

196
00:21:50.280 --> 00:22:08.049
Abimereki Muzaale: Definitely title. If I Google something I'm looking for topic. You're Googling with title, yeah, you can Google, another structure. It's such a for this subject. Yeah. So what you'd be interested in usually interested in one of the 3 things, whether it's

197
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:15.919
Abimereki Muzaale: Are you interested in subject? Are you interested in? Mike Tyson, punching. Only feel that is interested in box up.

198
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:34.859
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, boxing!

199
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.469
Patrick Muinda: And actually you will get.

200
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:49.269
Abimereki Muzaale: Then you're like, Oh, this schedule looks like what I want. Then you click on it. Then you're in the abstract be like, No. yeah. Oh, yes. Then you go beyond the abstract.

201
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.019
Patrick Muinda: So under the setting point.

202
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.480
Abimereki Muzaale: where should you put the most effort for selling.

203
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.820
Abimereki Muzaale: I would say title

204
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:27.100
Abimereki Muzaale: absolutely tell you this, but for me it's without a doubt the most important part of it makes complete sense. I mean. Now I suddenly see why I'm having too many fights and arguments over that. If Dad is said that I'm I'm happy to hear that. Because for me this I was a comment I had from the very beginning. I don't think I made that comment, because, you know, II hadn't read you obstructed

205
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:41.670
Abimereki Muzaale: anything, but now that II you wanted feedback specifically for something small which is nice a whole evening on this. And I did that stuck at the title.

206
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.720
Abimereki Muzaale: I got stuck. I'm changing that type. So

207
00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:54.260
Patrick Muinda: yes, oh, great! That was approved. It was. There's an approved title.

208
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.489
Patrick Muinda: but I know that can't change.

209
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:07.909
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, I'm happy here. I actually didn't think you could change the title, so I'm happy to hear what my business I told me is, my supervisor said the only thing that will never be allowed to change.

210
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:30.260
Patrick Muinda: Is your research. There is help. You question the question that you're answering. Ultimately it says, change. Once you change it, everything has changed. Everything has changed. Okay, you need approval again. And all that stuff exactly. Oh, good! Good! Oh, III probably click the title of the given, and that's not going anywhere. No, no, no, that's total change.

211
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:37.950
Abimereki Muzaale: So there. So because I'm a person who has never been very focused on my field. Even before I came to

212
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.769
Abimereki Muzaale: to Johns Hopkins I was never.

213
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:49.479
Abimereki Muzaale: never had been onto any field. And again, thanks to you, you introduced me to the most powerful thing in my life, which is music

214
00:24:49.590 --> 00:25:03.749
Abimereki Muzaale: I and II mean, I studied music up to Essex. People used to be like, I'm like, well, II don't know. Up to today

215
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:12.900
Abimereki Muzaale: music is a central part of my life. I was a when you come to music and the things that move me in music. Well.

216
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.730
Abimereki Muzaale: it's about human psychology.

217
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:28.999
Patrick Muinda: So music is good for human psychology. Every mode of human communication is about human psychology. Hmm, number 1 point, how much budget are you placing on the audience?

218
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.360
Abimereki Muzaale: And and and how does that affect communication?

219
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:57.600
Abimereki Muzaale: But what are you communicating? Are you communicating content or emotion. Now, music usually is not trying to communicate content to but has to be very effective. But here with science, we're not supposed to manipulate people's emotions. So it should be content to communicate. So that's

220
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:03.260
Abimereki Muzaale: what are you doing? So with the minimum button

221
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.389
Abimereki Muzaale: on your audience?

222
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.690
Abimereki Muzaale: And so for me. That's my concern. All the time

223
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:17.299
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm like I'm not writing for the sake of con making myself. No, no, no, no! I'm concerned

224
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:28.279
Abimereki Muzaale: about the audience, from from films of I wish him a film on the Live of Mozart play. Very good. You'd see the composer.

225
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:34.670
Abimereki Muzaale: He was to see the eyes reaction of the audience when that opera is being performed with his.

226
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:41.060
Patrick Muinda: Because that's it. It's not about how we feel about his music. No, no, no, he wants to see their reaction.

227
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:49.799
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, and so the title II was. I was really stuck there for a long time, so when II couldn't figure out what was going on. I was like, you know what?

228
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.170
Abimereki Muzaale: Gp, yeah.

229
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.110
Abimereki Muzaale: II can't find exactly where the stuff is. But II told you, gbt.

230
00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.850
Abimereki Muzaale: hmm.

231
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.650
Abimereki Muzaale: I tasted. I said this, this.

232
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.709
Abimereki Muzaale: this is the title of a doctoral thesis.

233
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Please help

234
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:18.090
Abimereki Muzaale: me analyze it in terms of subject. Verb.

235
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:25.449
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, that's what I told it. I was like I was still struggling. I was like Gbt.

236
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.020
Abimereki Muzaale: This is what I wanted to show. Share what you see in flight.

237
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:45.230
Abimereki Muzaale: You do not want anything in play that should be explicit like in not implicit. It should be. You know.

238
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.139
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm trying to remember, son? 23. Yeah, he leadeth me.

239
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:59.460
Abimereki Muzaale: He guided me. He restored my soul. I mean, there's no implied anything in some 23.

240
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.260
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, okay.

241
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.170
Abimereki Muzaale: nothing nothing

242
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:24.170
Abimereki Muzaale: everything is there. So the fact that cannot identify above. But it can understand your data. I mean, I understand everything in the human knowledge. But it's like, I understand, the the implied implied rather than explicitly stated. That's that means every day is going to struggle.

243
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.209
Patrick Muinda: GG. Does not see the verb here, isn't it?

244
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:43.559
Abimereki Muzaale: We? The basic says it's in play. That means there's no file. So let's go. Typically tenters, especially academic works, may not always have explicit jobs. That's what I meant by the old school science. Yeah.

245
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:57.119
Abimereki Muzaale: But modern science, we're more concerned with very concerned cause. Our readers are very distracted when when writing people had time to read in the 16 hundreds.

246
00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:07.299
Abimereki Muzaale: So you cannot.

247
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.300
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Hmm.

248
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:15.660
Abimereki Muzaale: you have to be like, tick tock. Yeah, that's a much, very short like Twitter

249
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:24.000
Abimereki Muzaale: 3 days for adults you have no room for. I will notice that Youtube now, I mean, Youtube now has shots

250
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.740
Patrick Muinda: because of the whole long thing

251
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.680
Abimereki Muzaale: because of Tiktok's success.

252
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:50.340
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, no time. So so yes. So why typically special academic may not always have a stuff. But I'm in my opinion. not opinion in my experience as a reader I was struggling to S. To understand the title, because I need to verb it something that's being done doing what

253
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.050
Abimereki Muzaale: the implied verb would be provides addresses. So you see, it's also speculating.

254
00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:10.370
Abimereki Muzaale: So you're rich, not speculate. This is the title should be the clearest thing, no room for speculation. So we need it. That's why, when I went to the papers project, you're walking on. I got excited. I save the problem.

255
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:15.069
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, II was like, yes,

256
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.400
Abimereki Muzaale: a

257
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:36.290
Abimereki Muzaale: continue. Oh, yeah.

258
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.160
Yeah.

259
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:49.300
Abimereki Muzaale: There's a very helpful experience for me, because, all the comments that made by the title. I was finding the answers before I reached even the abstract.

260
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.360
Patrick Muinda: When we're not fists.

261
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.710
Abimereki Muzaale: There's a vote

262
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.180
Abimereki Muzaale: it improves.

263
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.260
Abimereki Muzaale: I was like, yeah.

264
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:10.439
Abimereki Muzaale: this one I couldn't find. I couldn't find if so II speculated, and I'll show you where I speculated. But the verb might be

265
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:35.510
Abimereki Muzaale: back to here. The the title, so the web implies rather than explicitly provides, addresses. Does it create, destroy, change? Does it update? So those are questions which are kind of, is there something that exists? Yeah, like, I had? No, the title does not give us, Bob. We need a VoIP. So we're like, oh, does it apply? So I've read someone as like, oh, utilizes, users.

266
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.430
Abimereki Muzaale: uses. I was like, that's about like,

267
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:45.490
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, so that that that is one. Then. Yeah.

268
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:54.269
Abimereki Muzaale: as you can see, is a very long object which I've been struggling with. Digital. Of course I do not know what digital transformation is now, I know, I think.

269
00:31:54.750 --> 00:32:00.220
Abimereki Muzaale: It's a relatively new term in academia. It's not not very old.

270
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:08.429
Patrick Muinda: It's now new. So so that cuts of all of us who are not in that area.

271
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.440
Patrick Muinda: That may be okay.

272
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:22.740
Abimereki Muzaale: But it definitely cuts us off cuts off. Daddy, cut me off, and I'm a person who is very comfortable with things outside my field. But this one give me a hard time.

273
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:48.370
Abimereki Muzaale: No, not breaking further. But my, I I'll show you my interpretation, or we I mean the questions in my mind that. But in general

274
00:32:48.500 --> 00:33:03.200
Abimereki Muzaale: it's like a digital transformation in technical vocational Education Institution. When I asked what the what the subject? 2 days ago, he told me that the subject was not a framework, that the subject was

275
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:12.219
Abimereki Muzaale: the the institutions. That's what it told. He's saying. It's the framework. So it's giving me different answers.

276
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:17.159
Abimereki Muzaale: So then the thing that's cause the framework, is it the framework which is doing the verb.

277
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.130
Abimereki Muzaale: That's a good. Yeah. Is the framework providing

278
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.319
Abimereki Muzaale: the digital transformation. I don't think so. Social. Gbta is wrong.

279
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:34.490
Abimereki Muzaale: What do you think it's your is your is your title. I'm gonna say, I think what the framework is doing is to enable

280
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.020
the agent

281
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:45.610
Patrick Muinda: to achieve digital transformation. And the agent, therefore, is the institution right? No. The agent is the the project manager

282
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.160
Abimereki Muzaale: of the institution.

283
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:54.190
Patrick Muinda: Government hires a project coordination team

284
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.660
to do digital transformation for the institution.

285
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:08.310
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, you see all these things? These are questions that have been in my head answering them. You didn't every day is not that you're not there to defend your title

286
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:18.380
Abimereki Muzaale: to the world? Is your abstract?

287
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:24.200
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I see. but so for those who will reach the abstract.

288
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:44.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, cause I know who would drop off by that time. Yes, now. So if what you've told me is not in the abstract name then, you'll have to finish this. So for those who reach that, this is the entire body. So the agent would be a project manager.

289
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:50.699
Patrick Muinda: Yes, you. You have a budget like a World bank Project cause. This has a World Bank project.

290
00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:57.600
Patrick Muinda: I'm writing on the World Bank Project, and this project is being owned by government.

291
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.350
Patrick Muinda: Now government gets the the project coordinator

292
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:05.299
Patrick Muinda: to go and make sure all technical institutions

293
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.949
Patrick Muinda: turn from manual operations to digito operations and do digito transformation.

294
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.100
Patrick Muinda: But in the process.

295
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.880
Abimereki Muzaale: go ahead. Go ahead.

296
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:22.710
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. So in the process, you get to realize one. The agent doesn't seem to understand the assignment.

297
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:31.220
Patrick Muinda: 2. The agent is actually sure that they they have understood it, but implementing it very, very poor.

298
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.169
Patrick Muinda: very, very poor, and as such so much money is being lost.

299
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:43.640
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm so happy to hear that agent cause while, yeah, we're using subject verb object, because subject and object confuse me so much.

300
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.260
Abimereki Muzaale: Necessarily use the right agent instead of subject.

301
00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:53.440
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so I'm happy to hear you saying the agent, but agent for agent

302
00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:01.599
Patrick Muinda: now the agent will need that framework. The agent will need the framework to guide them on how to do the work.

303
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.940
Patrick Muinda: So what has been happening is the the agent has not been using the framework.

304
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.340
even the even the the managers have not been referring to the framework to guide the agent.

305
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:24.709
Abimereki Muzaale:  So an agent is using it to needs it. This is a tool for agent, and gives him agency.

306
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.840
Yes, it does.

307
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:33.240
Patrick Muinda: and and the agent and the principal, the 2 of them, must be in agreement

308
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.970
Patrick Muinda: cause. I know

309
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.570
Patrick Muinda: it's a pretty simple.

310
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.410
Patrick Muinda: The Prince was the owner of the budget. That's government.

311
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:52.330
Patrick Muinda: Okay? So the the government must be very clear to the project. Coordinator. What they want ultimately as the overall outcome.

312
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.499
Patrick Muinda: If they don't come out clearly, you're going to have a goal conflict.

313
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.600
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you look at your title.

314
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:07.729
Abimereki Muzaale: You know how many people you would be able to invite to this title if they knew. This is a topic of agents and principles.

315
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.060
Abimereki Muzaale: the whole economics, everyone in the degree in economics.

316
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.720
Abimereki Muzaale: everyone. Seriously.

317
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.569
Abimereki Muzaale: everyone would.

318
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:34.210
Abimereki Muzaale: That agency theory is a big deal in economics. Yeah, yes. And I think in social science, sociology, too. What I mean, I think the very basis of social work and all that is lifetime

319
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.550
Patrick Muinda: is, yeah. People have an agency.

320
00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.110
Yes.

321
00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.719
Abimereki Muzaale: so this this whole study is on that.

322
00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:57.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I'm telling you we've we've crushed as as as government, because people don't understand this. There you go! There you go. I think there's a diagnosis that so many levels here. Wow.

323
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:08.430
Patrick Muinda: because when I was reading and I reached your, I think. Was it definitions, or was it those papers agency here as a quote?

324
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.129
Abimereki Muzaale: Was he here?

325
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:20.339
Abimereki Muzaale: An agency? Here is like Whoa agents? Because for me, agency, when I say, agent, I see. Subject.

326
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.130
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, I see. Subject. I'm like, Oh.

327
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:34.729
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, yes. So so we have an agent here. But who is the agent? Improved success of digital transfer product?

328
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:49.819
Abimereki Muzaale: No. So in terms of agency in the language, sense, forget it about science. If government is the principle, what does it mean generally in, in, in, in, in social sciences. If a principle has hired an agent.

329
00:38:49.820 --> 00:39:07.439
Abimereki Muzaale: So yeah, finally, all in business this is a very Christian conversation I had. For adding money, they used to group.

330
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.650
Patrick Muinda: yes, yeah.

331
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.720
Abimereki Muzaale: now, I remember that idea. And it's like.

332
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.439
Abimereki Muzaale: so what happens when a family owned business hires a CEO.

333
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.389
Abimereki Muzaale: We have grown to that level

334
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.240
Abimereki Muzaale: cause. That family? The principal

335
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:56.109
Abimereki Muzaale: right. What is the meaning of that hiring? Why are you hiring an agent. Is it because you don't have agency?

336
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:07.690
Patrick Muinda: In a sense that you you you want to enjoy the spoils, or probably it's a more modern world. And the level of skill specialization requires

337
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:11.539
Patrick Muinda: when that one has come to. Yes, such as coming to.

338
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.850
Abimereki Muzaale: So basically, the principle doesn't have agency.

339
00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:23.310
Abimereki Muzaale: So so the principal, if the principle is government, they don't have agents in their hiring and management.

340
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:27.619
Patrick Muinda: So this manager typically not be within the bureaucratic structure.

341
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:41.249
Patrick Muinda: No, that is how the hired people, they are hired like consultant. They are about 8 of them, and each of them are very highly specialized. Running accounts is super

342
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:47.070
Patrick Muinda: specialized there than in procurement is almost specialized. And even the one in government

343
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:52.640
Patrick Muinda: in that order. There's a team called the Project Coordination unit

344
00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:05.070
Abimereki Muzaale: no. So so I so so so this, this, yeah, yeah, I didn't even see this coming. Well, so I just wanted to show off that

345
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:09.460
Abimereki Muzaale: going to the basics of a beautiful thing like some 23?

346
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.480
Patrick Muinda: Yes, everything is laid out in this.

347
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:20.730
Abimereki Muzaale: No one is. You will not find a person struggling to understand some 33. That's the I just want to use that as the benchmark.

348
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:28.470
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, I'm not suggesting that you use metaphors. Cause science will not allow that. That's for us.

349
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:37.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Describe what you're describing. Yeah, you can't say, oh, this is compared with some metaphor, some other image signs.

350
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:45.180
Abimereki Muzaale: But but ideas are the same, that is, if you want people to understand you

351
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.890
Abimereki Muzaale: as much as possible, the way poets do. Poets are better than scientists.

352
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:57.920
Abimereki Muzaale: but the doubt most famous people in the world are always artists. never scientists.

353
00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:05.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, make a big name, but in general celebrities that because there was successfully communicating

354
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:14.559
Abimereki Muzaale: Santa's are the worst are the very worst. Yeah. And so, if we may borrow which I've spent my entire life doing

355
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:23.469
Abimereki Muzaale: is is living in the world of science and art. If I may borrow from art, it's the understanding of human psychology.

356
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.020
Abimereki Muzaale: and that is your goal is not to throw things at people

357
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:35.430
Abimereki Muzaale: and make sure you've not missed anything. No, it's to engage this before catch them.

358
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.660
Abimereki Muzaale: And so.

359
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:45.079
Abimereki Muzaale: if you are totally interested in engaging people who are not in government. but IT

360
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:51.770
Abimereki Muzaale: language that in will catch them now.

361
00:42:52.870 --> 00:43:00.059
Abimereki Muzaale: many doctors, for instance, may not understand agency theory but everyone in such a science as well.

362
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:11.319
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, and very strong. engaging, engaging the reader from the beginning. Somewhere in the title, somewhere in the abstract.

363
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.740
and the very opening sentence of the abstract opening sentence of the introduction.

364
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:27.530
Abimereki Muzaale: Get them there like you've been able to make me understand the entire thesis of your but in general, by just agent versus principal

365
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:34.879
Abimereki Muzaale: the principal is, the issue really is sort of the principal lacks agency.

366
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.580
Patrick Muinda: Yes.

367
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.310
Abimereki Muzaale: so I'm going to ask Cha Jupiti.

368
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.060
Abimereki Muzaale: We have a principal.

369
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.540
Abimereki Muzaale: the government have you gotten it?

370
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.000
Yup

371
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.740
Abimereki Muzaale: Ulax agency

372
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.920
Abimereki Muzaale: and has therefore

373
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.460
Abimereki Muzaale: hired an agent?

374
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.960
Abimereki Muzaale: Is it? Project manager

375
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.330
projects? Yeah. Go ahead and say

376
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:16.480
Patrick Muinda: we were. They had full project 3 id, or there's a project coordinator I had. I had a project

377
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.260
Abimereki Muzaale: coordinator

378
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.140
Abimereki Muzaale: to.

379
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.330
Abimereki Muzaale: What's above here. What? So what is

380
00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:38.790
Abimereki Muzaale: so if if we're the Mazarin on this brewery competing with the what would be doing was try to create, maybe grow to grow grow our company.

381
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.910
Abimereki Muzaale: So if we have, yeah, yeah, we need information.

382
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:46.059
Patrick Muinda: because the project implement, yeah, that's a nice job

383
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.600
Abimereki Muzaale: implement

384
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.690
Abimereki Muzaale: implement

385
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:57.050
Patrick Muinda: this, this is this is we can say to implement digitalization.

386
00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.750
Abimereki Muzaale: digitalization, yeah.

387
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.609
Abimereki Muzaale: at the end of the day, it's

388
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.680
Abimereki Muzaale: I like to think of it as a platform.

389
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:10.930
Abimereki Muzaale: It is your platform. Right? Okay? Eliza, digitalization.

390
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:19.409
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, education institutions.

391
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.430
Yeah.

392
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:31.230
Abimereki Muzaale: we have a principal. The Governor of Uganda relax agents and has therefore, had an agent for the United to implement digitalization of education institutions.

393
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.660
Abimereki Muzaale: Would you use

394
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.440
Abimereki Muzaale: subject, verb.

395
00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.430
Abimereki Muzaale: object.

396
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.700
active voice

397
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.020
Abimereki Muzaale: to

398
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.980
Abimereki Muzaale: improve?

399
00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.059
Abimereki Muzaale: Clarity of the title

400
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.530
Abimereki Muzaale: and abstract. Here is the title

401
00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:01.239
Abimereki Muzaale: this is a teacher.

402
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, my God!

403
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.890
Patrick Muinda: Oh, my gosh.

404
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:18.069
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, I don't think it remembers the abstract would give it already. So yeah, yeah, I've learned that. Oh, you need to keep pasting, because otherwise,

405
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.909
Abimereki Muzaale: go really crazy something that's completely off.

406
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.489
Abimereki Muzaale: You're like, where did you get that from?

407
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.949
Patrick Muinda:  That is true.

408
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.840
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's see.

409
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:40.809
Patrick Muinda: You know I studied robotics, you know, when I studied robotics, III didn't understand things the way. I'm understanding them now. Can't you imagine?

410
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.780
Abimereki Muzaale: I can't imagine? Yeah, I

411
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:49.430
Patrick Muinda: but I did all this, but it was totally out of context to the real life.

412
00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:56.440
Abimereki Muzaale:  what do you notice about the title?

413
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.219
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. The Government of Uganda invents a framework.

414
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.180
Abimereki Muzaale: Look, look at this

415
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.430
Abimereki Muzaale: advocate.

416
00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.750
Patrick Muinda: It's hypervising.

417
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:18.470
Abimereki Muzaale: advancing you. You you know, you know what I had used amplifying. Oh, that's that's that's fine. then you have to ask yourself. II like advancing because advancing.

418
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:19.899
Abimereki Muzaale: It is simpler.

419
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:43.010
Patrick Muinda: amplifying it, but advising, moving forward exactly. And remember, this study is about an extension of this study by Mahani Mahania, 2,003. This at that time technology was not what it is today. And on top of that

420
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.250
it was in the context of the Us.

421
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.539
Abimereki Muzaale: If you feel like there's a paper that's pivotal.

422
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:59.849
Abimereki Muzaale: You can get the very important sentence from its abstract, like the abstract and phrases you use

423
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:14.440
Abimereki Muzaale: so that people know what you're building on. Because, what, when I think of the title I was like, are you creating something new? Are you inventing visit?

424
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:33.319
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Something that has been established and successful. Now I can understand why Uganda cause it's like, why you kinda you know, it's like, this is science. So but anyway, here's an example. Oh.

425
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:40.060
Abimereki Muzaale: this is not as brief as expected. I didn't leave it.

426
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.309
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, you and gleaming abstract.

427
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:46.720
Abimereki Muzaale: But you can please limit the abstract.

428
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.340
Abimereki Muzaale: Let let's do it. Take, let's do it. Take 2.

429
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.570
Abimereki Muzaale: Remembering you can do that.

430
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's see, you can tell me to that.

431
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:02.600
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's let's see. Let's see. We'll find out remembering some abstract and perhaps

432
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.850
Abimereki Muzaale: limit

433
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:11.909
Abimereki Muzaale: to less than I'm gonna send through 50 which is generous. I feel my agenda is usually 200.

434
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.330
Patrick Muinda: Okay.

435
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:25.360
Abimereki Muzaale: absolutely. I wish I could do that. Energetic enhancing is very good.

436
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.249
Abimereki Muzaale: Uganda's framework.

437
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:39.540
Abimereki Muzaale: Guess who the agent is. The agent has appeared. You got it agency, and has had an agent.

438
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:43.060
Patrick Muinda: Oh, it's you kind of going down

439
00:49:43.230 --> 00:50:06.430
Abimereki Muzaale: if you get, and the web is enhancing and and and looks like. You know, the digital transformation is the object according to this title, and I think that's correct. No, wait. A second. Is that correct? The object is what is being done. So so that's the whatever platform. Let's see how this goes. Le, let's let's just read this through. And

440
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.939
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, Chris, what you feel is so important. And that's missing.

441
00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:12.820
Okay.

442
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.209
Abimereki Muzaale: it has kept your language.

443
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:25.660
Abimereki Muzaale:  in the evolving global education realm. you guys, government? Yes.

444
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:32.839
Abimereki Muzaale: through its technical vocational institutions actively, champions, digital whoo! That's an invitation.

445
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.320
Patrick Muinda: Chairman's digital technology is that is that accurate

446
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.700
Abimereki Muzaale: in the spirit of it? Yes, it does.

447
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:51.920
Abimereki Muzaale: That is true. That's what government is doing. Okay, that's that's so. I think it's a very exciting sentence. really. Yeah, for skill, for skill. Development. Yes, yes, yes.

448
00:50:52.150 --> 00:51:01.070
Abimereki Muzaale: and that's what education is all about transferring. I don't think it hasn't said is how much money we we put in, or that comes into the background.

449
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:13.559
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, that's very good. That's so. We can throw it in the abstract abstract and see. Then then you'll see that you'd be like. Oh, I think you're muted. Is there mining in here in this abstract here

450
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:21.069
Abimereki Muzaale: or no? I didn't put it there. Oh, oh, yeah, cause it can't make up anything that you give it. Yeah, okay.

451
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:42.510
Abimereki Muzaale: so the initiative in prison is across multiple developing economies. So this is a question I had in my mind. I was like, why, Uganda, like there, there's nothing in the title and abstract that allowed me to appreciate is Uganda in Uganda. But here it's the Uganda Government, other agent, or at least they hire the agent.

452
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:44.130
Abimereki Muzaale: the Amazon.

453
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:51.000
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yes, that that's that's something I'm struggling with. I was struggling So

454
00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:57.040
Abimereki Muzaale: now this takes us allows us to see beyond. You guys see? Reason, it's

455
00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:05.840
Abimereki Muzaale: across monthly.

456
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.730
Abimereki Muzaale: However, a startling 70%

457
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:25.699
Patrick Muinda: of a transmission projects. I. So for what I've had. It's really projects projects project manager, or is sort of what the government is using. Yeah. And I've been struggling with, I should not simply call it digital transformation in Uganda

458
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.399
or still maintain projects

459
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:37.660
Abimereki Muzaale: project. Because I can tell you, even I have California when you talk of this digital transformation because the verb transform.

460
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.590
Abimereki Muzaale: I do not. It's abstract.

461
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.639
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. But I think that one.

462
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.340
Abimereki Muzaale: The project is a common noun

463
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.149
Abimereki Muzaale: and so no one is, gonna be like, what's the project? The only question would be like, What's this project about? But not what a project is.

464
00:52:55.270 --> 00:53:06.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So II thought, possibly. Yeah in Uganda, resulting in significant financial losses. Oh, you said that it didn't mention. So you could put numbers yet. But as measure that

465
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.770
Patrick Muinda: okay, that one that one comes eventually.

466
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:34.399
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So with 99% message, every other dollar invested, I'm invited here. This is opening. That's a true background. Yeah. Now let's see the high failure rate, and you can see how it has moved from the the, the, the main topic which is failure now, building on that cause given us context.

467
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.769
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, the high failure rate, this goes the absence of solid it. Governance. I'm like.

468
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.409
this is the thing they don't understand. Like it governs, yeah.

469
00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:50.129
Patrick Muinda: And and because in government, in governments just refers to to how an it person should manage. That is all.

470
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.730
Patrick Muinda: Nothing complex.

471
00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:59.789
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, okay? So you guys, Ministry of Education. Senior management delegates, project

472
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:12.850
Abimereki Muzaale: implementation to oh, wait a second project implementation. They get project. Yes, this is good.

473
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:20.950
Abimereki Muzaale: This, is it this? This? Is it because, Daniel be invited now, because.

474
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:27.210
Abimereki Muzaale: of course, it's Uganda government. So it's the government.

475
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:36.190
Abimereki Muzaale: This is so clear. This is, I'm I'm having a yeah yeah, to specialize project. Coordinators

476
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:45.430
Abimereki Muzaale: compromise versus quality posing challenges successful digital. Transformation

477
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:52.220
Patrick Muinda: chaos is a.

478
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:57.170
Patrick Muinda: it is a magazine that comes out every 2 years.

479
00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:06.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, and does research on 50,000 institutions every 2 years on projects on it projects.

480
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:20.490
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. Now, this really, really authority that's good. Now, this is the basis of all science to. So at least now I'll be like, Oh, you're not inventing anything.

481
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.540
Abimereki Muzaale: because the existing existing solutions. For

482
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:41.589
Abimereki Muzaale: in response study introduces in a beautiful bob. Yeah. Tailored no. If now, with the name of the toffee, the title teamwork for improved.

483
00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.059
Abimereki Muzaale: There's a vowel.

484
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.380
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, cause there's no follow up before

485
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:59.909
Abimereki Muzaale: improve. Yeah, or they like the one of advancing, but feel, feel feel free to to replace this is the framework for advancing.

486
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:10.679
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, th, this framework tag is a reduction of project failures like, Oh. okay. Aiming like the motivation has been nailed.

487
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:21.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Understand why you've invested for years. This is our research objectives encompass identifying the essentials

488
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:27.759
Abimereki Muzaale: for effective digital transformation. There's a term of land. Called tokens.

489
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:35.510
Abimereki Muzaale: Tokens token so like G. Ch. Was trained on 1.3 trillion tokens

490
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:40.920
Abimereki Muzaale: and tokens just like you remember ha!

491
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.959
Abimereki Muzaale: Place where we used to go to play games

492
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.900
Patrick Muinda: San Francisco.

493
00:56:47.190 --> 00:57:00.159
Abimereki Muzaale: No, not not not actual games like 4. I think we had to buy tokens. I don't remember. Buy tokens you. You buy that coin like token. Yes.

494
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:20.810
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. Tokens. What does tokens mean?

495
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:28.359
Abimereki Muzaale: This usage of tokens? But that's what tokens is where is it?

496
00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:41.499
Abimereki Muzaale:  then, really, the those essentials are units, like the actual things that can be listed.

497
00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.279
Patrick Muinda: what makes what makes

498
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:52.820
Abimereki Muzaale: I what makes success in digital transformation. It won't be good if it feels advanced.

499
00:57:52.940 --> 00:58:00.690
Abimereki Muzaale: I could say they're 9 things, or they're 7 things. But if you, it means a field is not advanced.

500
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:17.299
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes. Now, if you could coin tokens in your update this this is.

501
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:19.640
Abimereki Muzaale: and you can throw them in the abstract

502
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:28.019
Abimereki Muzaale: in the intro, and you build your entire thesis around this. It's okay for me to to mention them here

503
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:48.619
Abimereki Muzaale: because I have done structured equation modeling, and I hope the fact that we call them token correct language for me. I got this language world the time I use it every time. Yeah, enrolled in Gospel Music University.

504
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.090
Patrick Muinda: Hello.

505
00:58:51.610 --> 00:59:04.999
Abimereki Muzaale: I. I'm just going to take about 3 min of use to go off topic but to show. Don't worry. II have all the time I'm not going anywhere.

506
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:11.639
Abimereki Muzaale: So I was introduced to African American

507
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:19.630
Abimereki Muzaale: in the nineties. And so the the groups that do what? The winens, not the CC, the CC. The young siblings, ruby and CC,

508
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:35.729
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, but the winners like past the Marvin whiners, who is literally coastal concept. He introduced me, and I failed to reproduce the style of African American gospel. When I play it's been a frustration.

509
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.210
Abimereki Muzaale: This was. I was about what? 14 years old. I'm now

510
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.750
Abimereki Muzaale: 30 years. Is it? 30 years? 30 years later.

511
00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:49.239
Abimereki Muzaale: I know, struggling to reproduce that African American sound? Yup.

512
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:55.679
Abimereki Muzaale: So let's see, what's the name of it? So Gospel Music University.

513
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.020
Abimereki Muzaale: So

514
00:59:57.130 --> 01:00:02.770
Abimereki Muzaale:  it's not here.

515
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.230
Abimereki Muzaale: Let me go to another minute. So

516
01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:15.130
Abimereki Muzaale: I asked as a Youtube looking for video for something, and Youtube refuses to give me my video until I have to watch. Add to watch your all advice.

517
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.109
Abimereki Muzaale: II write voice

518
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:28.949
Abimereki Muzaale: because for Music University, and the Guide nailed everything I've been looking for in music for the last 30 years. II was like I clicked it, and I had to sign up

519
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.299
Abimereki Muzaale: so for the last 2 months I've been in school.

520
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, credit units! I've been spending about 3 HA day.

521
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:48.869
Abimereki Muzaale: Learning! But what struck me is the tokens cause I'd been struggling with Chajupite, understanding how it was built. and I discovered time tokens. and I'm like, wait a second.

522
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:55.710
Abimereki Muzaale: This process that I've been through the Gospel Music university. I've literally been handed tokens.

523
01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm, okay.

524
01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:10.249
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm going to give you an example. So this is a this is a the the detailed lectures like videos that. Th. This young man is like 34 isn't assistant professor at one of the universities at Black. Yeah, of course.

525
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.580
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm.

526
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.799
Abimereki Muzaale: Trinidad, but raised, born and raised in the Us. But his farm is from Trinidad.

527
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:21.039
Abimereki Muzaale: Hmm I he as an outsider

528
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.920
Abimereki Muzaale: who is not African American. He's able to analyze

529
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:34.450
Abimereki Muzaale: gospel in a way that an African American can, because African Americans have it. They've been raised in it.

530
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.810
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, from outside and seeing things, but also studied academically

531
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.210
Abimereki Muzaale: and reduces it to this end. That is making this case and is a millionaire

532
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:53.149
Abimereki Muzaale: teaching what the whole world wants to learn. African American gospel music has its very rich. It's depth.

533
01:01:53.270 --> 01:02:01.589
Abimereki Muzaale: These are tokens like literally 123-45-6789, then 9 courts.

534
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:12.820
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Hmm. So so it's not like all the chords in music cause. Cause. If someone asked you how many quotes of it you'd be like, huh? Well, cause you have not thought about it in terms of tokens.

535
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:15.510
Patrick Muinda: yeah, or a checklist.

536
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:20.249
Abimereki Muzaale: this guy would sit at night. even if even you get the best music

537
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.030
Abimereki Muzaale: musician in in gospel, the gospel, who wouldn't have an answer?

538
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:39.560
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, but because because for that person knows it intuitively right, that the best gospel pianist he can't teach. You can't teach, he can you, with his performance, but it can't teach you

539
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.990
Patrick Muinda: but this person can teach you.

540
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.050
Abimereki Muzaale: and that's what he's done

541
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:56.939
Abimereki Muzaale: listed the tokens. Yeah, major minor dominant gives them. Then available tensions. So tensions are things that are not in the standard that goes. Chris.

542
01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:03.779
Patrick Muinda: cause me. Music is my. That stress. That stress here is is related to 9 11 repeatedly.

543
01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:11.730
Abimereki Muzaale:  there you go! Just the intest. September.

544
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:20.410
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, okay. 9, 11. I miss that. That is so funny. That is so funny.

545
01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:37.970
Patrick Muinda: You mean the outcome of what someone has played, and now it makes the listener feel. No, so tension is is number one is gospel. Is that tonic? So that tonic is if you say you're in the key of C.

546
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.979
Abimereki Muzaale: The only notes are the white ones.

547
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.879
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes. So if you play the courts give me a second. Just give me a second.

548
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.100
Abimereki Muzaale: Our.

549
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.970
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh.

550
01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:03.019
Abimereki Muzaale: so is that something I discovered in line cost me $75

551
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:09.210
Patrick Muinda: the keyboard? Yes.

552
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:16.660
Patrick Muinda: yes, you did. I was. I was really amused by that. Yeah. So I'm definitely bringing this to Uganda. So

553
01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:23.360
Abimereki Muzaale: the budget's flat. So that's too bad. You don't have a USB.

554
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:34.229
Abimereki Muzaale: Is a USB. But anyway, I just let me know getting off topic. The general idea that 20 cords is Dorami Durami Dorami. So if you play the cords, C

555
01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:44.380
Abimereki Muzaale: d. Minor, EF, Major G. Major, then the one in the seventh is called it

556
01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:49.209
Abimereki Muzaale: minus 7 mine, minus 6 mine

557
01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.330
Abimereki Muzaale: these.

558
01:04:50.790 --> 01:05:05.850
Abimereki Muzaale: What's the letter? BB minor? But the fifth is flat. cause should be with it with a black note. The F sharp, yes, yes, but but in in the dead 20 the black notes don't exist.

559
01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:11.429
Abimereki Muzaale: So that's it. So it's flat. So it's be minor flat. 5. Cause that's a

560
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.860
Abimereki Muzaale: this is a deadly chorus that goes for music is based on any black notes, if you can see his attention.

561
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:26.799
Patrick Muinda: Yes, that's intention. So so what?

562
01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:46.610
Abimereki Muzaale: While setting charge Gp. And being buffered by it, and then being told these things as like, Oh, my goodness! The way charge is how the human mind works. This is how I've been. I've been trained, and now I can produce a goes for sound. The black African American goes for sound because I've been given the tokens

563
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:51.539
Abimereki Muzaale: that pros the profession is custom. Music professionals use.

564
01:05:51.980 --> 01:06:11.929
Abimereki Muzaale: They know them is individually, subconsciously. But if you're from outside that community black church, where, if preacher is accompanied by the organist does say something.

565
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:21.260
Abimereki Muzaale: I just wanted to show you that

566
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:28.269
Abimereki Muzaale: So I have these things right now. They're in my head. And so a professional musician has all these things in his head

567
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:33.840
Abimereki Muzaale: because of how the structured it works the same when you change keys.

568
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:41.280
Abimereki Muzaale: and also their limits, their rules. You have added so many rules. They like this

569
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.610
Abimereki Muzaale: many. So I've crumbed all these rules.

570
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:57.369
Abimereki Muzaale: discuss and understood from them most of them their checklist. It's a profession. Yeah, if you had to create new things or break away and create something you find. But if you understand, sound like a black gospel.

571
01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:02.679
Abimereki Muzaale: organists, you have to follow those rules. They've been created over 400.

572
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:12.809
Abimereki Muzaale: So just just to follow up on this when you come eventually end of this year. Hopefully, I want you to come and have setup

573
01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:20.860
Patrick Muinda: the keyboards prefers and everything so that we can do these things. Let's that'd be fine.

574
01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:45.930
Abimereki Muzaale: Uganda. Cause

575
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.270
Abimereki Muzaale: could I do that at the beginning? I'm like.

576
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.730
Abimereki Muzaale: absolutely give the reader the tokens.

577
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.980
Abimereki Muzaale: Wednesday. Where were we?

578
01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:03.099
Abimereki Muzaale: Where were we? Oh, my goodness, yes, yeah, yes, right? Yeah.

579
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:09.450
Abimereki Muzaale: Give the reader the tokens, and if even you have a number and give it to the reader and say, there are.

580
01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:15.299
Abimereki Muzaale: And so the the checklists in medicine and in aviation

581
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:24.319
Abimereki Muzaale: payloads have a checklist before they take off. Yeah. Let's check things. The things they check. They don't check them randomly.

582
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:30.690
Abimereki Muzaale: cause you mine, which is critical. So you have to do those checkers. So it

583
01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:42.509
Abimereki Muzaale: Sajid. There's a professor. There's a Professor Joe's book is we introduced a checklist for surgery introduced into. They published a paper in, I think, 2,006,

584
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.009
2,003.

585
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:47.830
Abimereki Muzaale: The paper's a big hit. Yeah. Hmm.

586
01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:50.260
Abimereki Muzaale: checklist.

587
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:56.339
Abimereki Muzaale: Surgical pernovos. Pronovost is a professor

588
01:08:57.189 --> 01:09:01.540
Abimereki Muzaale: that can't be. The paper says that you want citations.

589
01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.560
Abimereki Muzaale: no

590
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.890
Abimereki Muzaale: checklists, critical care.

591
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.839
Abimereki Muzaale: critical care checklist. So this is tokens

592
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:17.789
Abimereki Muzaale: of us. Front of us is a professor who did this. Why is it giving me.

593
01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:25.980
Abimereki Muzaale: You know I know how to do this. Let me go to Google Scholar. I went. I'm all I'm trying to do. Decide to bring this to the forefront of your thesis

594
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:34.349
Abimereki Muzaale: Google Scola. It will solve all the buttons I I've been worrying about for the reader, Google Scola.

595
01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:38.010
Abimereki Muzaale: Peter. I know the host.

596
01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:42.880
Abimereki Muzaale: Peter Pronovost. 5,000.

597
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.630
Patrick Muinda: My!

598
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.839
Look at that.

599
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:55.479
Abimereki Muzaale: This 5,000 citations, and you remember number one journal, New England Journal of Medicine. Hmm!

600
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:57.440
Abimereki Muzaale: Look! Look! Look! Look at that data.

601
01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.170
Abimereki Muzaale: Look at what

602
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:08.090
Abimereki Muzaale: Needham Needham was. My was a mentor for short time when I just Canadian. So you see this number on journal?

603
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.070
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes.

604
01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:16.120
Abimereki Muzaale: decrease. Yeah, there's no, there's no confusion. There's a verb.

605
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.840
Abimereki Muzaale: And what's been decreased

606
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:30.010
Abimereki Muzaale: planetary related blood streaming fictions. No, no confusion. There's no agent mentioned here. Yeah. So it's just a option. So obviously, patients

607
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.399
Abimereki Muzaale: implied. I see you in terms of care. Efficiency. So, but the verb is there. Yeah.

608
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.039
Abimereki Muzaale: And there is a checklist. Let's see.

609
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.239
Abimereki Muzaale: because this is a very famous topic

610
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:52.620
Abimereki Muzaale: and evidence based intervention resulted in large and sustained reduction. 66 woo in rates of category related. But it's huge.

611
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.100
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I'm looking for the white checklist

612
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:59.629
Abimereki Muzaale: cause that's what it's called check control if it's there.

613
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:04.150
Abimereki Muzaale: So I see checklist was used to ensure adherence.

614
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:14.280
Abimereki Muzaale:  so use get language, either use something, checklist, token, or check. This maybe, is simplest stuff.

615
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.930
Abimereki Muzaale: Yep.

616
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:20.200
Patrick Muinda: and that and the question is

617
01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:29.119
Abimereki Muzaale: you, you you could apply. You could if there's a if there's literature like the American paper as a checklist of what agents as opposed to do

618
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.810
Abimereki Muzaale: the hired agents that government hired

619
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:42.840
Abimereki Muzaale: success for success, to check this for success cause here the success is not having fictions for participation in the intensive care unit.

620
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:54.419
Abimereki Muzaale: That's good. So in your case, again, you guys should clarify. And this is title. And the communication message. So if the goal is to have a checklist

621
01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:08.059
Abimereki Muzaale: of what's so successful in America? But then the question is, what should we use the same checklist for Uganda. That is a success. Or actually, we don't know.

622
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:23.580
Abimereki Muzaale: Should we develop a checklist for Uganda? Is your framework like creating, reinventing the W. Which is a bad thing. Yeah. So what is it? Yeah. But the idea of checklists using the spirit out of the spirit of music?

623
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.360
Abimereki Muzaale: That there's a checklist. Actually.

624
01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:33.249
Abimereki Muzaale: that profession is used and and and professionals use this checklist

625
01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:39.329
Abimereki Muzaale: within half a second while playing a a professional can compose a song, live

626
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.610
Abimereki Muzaale: very complex, sophisticated. Just

627
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:50.609
Abimereki Muzaale: that. You're just improvising, like, yes, because that's checklist, which they've been playing around with for 20 years that years.

628
01:12:50.820 --> 01:13:02.390
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So same thing with your thesis? A. What are those essentials for effective digital transformation? Can you give me a number and say 7

629
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:07.309
Abimereki Muzaale: they live in if you cut it? How's that

630
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:12.799
Abimereki Muzaale: in your abstract, by all means, and give it a name like checklist, or some name

631
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:16.999
Abimereki Muzaale: and torture the reader with that from beginning to end.

632
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:32.729
Abimereki Muzaale: and the literature becomes your tool in the literature, the you're citing literature to show that. Oh, actually, this is the literature literature talks about these things. There's no one person was put them together. I am the one now putting them together as a checklist.

633
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:40.229
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Bring it from the literature which includes the checklist by Mahoney and Ledra.

634
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:56.079
Patrick Muinda: the first from the one that will have for you band. And you know how to tell us why you're not reinventing the wheel, otherwise people will be like this is in effect, oh, my friend, it has been very well explained through very rigorous research.

635
01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:02.880
Abimereki Muzaale: The bugs. Your question is the abstract absolutely the best gift you could give to the reader

636
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:05.869
Abimereki Muzaale: as the very beginning.

637
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:25.519
Abimereki Muzaale: Be more striking soon as yeah, like. Here. So here you talk about our research objective encompasses identifying. You could say, a checklist, yeah, or something that checklist and something. Yeah.

638
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:33.129
Abimereki Muzaale: a checklist. I'm going to use because those 6

639
01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.140
Patrick Muinda: constructs that are used in this particular model.

640
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.369
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, actually, I had a checklist.

641
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.560
Abimereki Muzaale: There we go. So I think. Cause

642
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.980
Patrick Muinda: yeah.

643
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.719
Abimereki Muzaale: So I just think that those those items, if

644
01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.300
Patrick Muinda: ticked off as done. Well, then.

645
01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.949
Patrick Muinda: we have very, very effective projects that we shall have.

646
01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:05.830
Abimereki Muzaale: So what I'm seeing is that I think I've been able to communicate online communicate number one. My struggles to understand the topic

647
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:28.410
Abimereki Muzaale: now the the tool I've used for me to understand, which I believe is a tool of many people outside. If you can help someone outside your area, understand? What about the people in your area like.

648
01:15:43.030 --> 01:16:03.230
Abimereki Muzaale: of course, it's a probably 6 is, I think. But but but the Id. Let's just say, Mom, your mom is not in in the field right? But she's she cares about what you're doing. Yeah. So she has time for you to listen to what you say what they're working on. And you're like,

649
01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:12.610
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, and so if you can explain to your mom, then definitely, the people in your field can understand. So I don't think your target

650
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:23.330
Abimereki Muzaale: your standards should be to understand. I don't think that should be your goal. I mean, that should be your goal, but not just standard, you should have a higher standard

651
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.909
Abimereki Muzaale: that is getting my understanding.

652
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:30.969
Abimereki Muzaale: and from my humble view

653
01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:39.930
Abimereki Muzaale: I hope I've convinced you that to get Mummy to understand. You love to use this secret tool I used by the service.

654
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:52.940
Abimereki Muzaale: That is simplicity. Sv. O. And even better removes S. And replace it with agent, a a VO agent! Verb object.

655
01:16:53.060 --> 01:17:06.619
Abimereki Muzaale: and and once it's agent where like oh, either the agent is Uganda or the AI. The agent is like, you know, I need to hire a better agent because I like agency so agent. And that summarizes this pieces.

656
01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.980
Abimereki Muzaale: An agent

657
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.570
Abimereki Muzaale: with someone who liked agency, Uganda Government had an agent.

658
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:28.530
Abimereki Muzaale: the project manager, the principle. So the person was I. The agent becomes a principle and language. So II don't think we should go on with this meeting for long, because they the email brain doesn't have capacity to do

659
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.969
Abimereki Muzaale: to take a few things. So we should stop. But

660
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:41.279
Abimereki Muzaale: number one definitely, the checklist is the winner, and all the things we've discussed, because I think that's caught your attention.

661
01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:45.759
Abimereki Muzaale: It must appear in the abstract

662
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:49.579
Abimereki Muzaale: and use it as a framework with this to structure your literature

663
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:51.800
Abimereki Muzaale: review.

664
01:17:52.050 --> 01:18:12.329
Abimereki Muzaale: I'd say Paypal, which doesn't even mention checklist or mentioned 3 of 11 items is is it's problematic. You're like, Oh, it does miss this 7. And then this is a checklist from America. You need to clarify that. Why, you're adopting a a new checklist.

665
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:15.819
Abimereki Muzaale: and then people would be invited because no one

666
01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:20.920
Abimereki Muzaale: reinventing the wheel is not a good thing, because it's a waste of

667
01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.030
Patrick Muinda: it's a waste of resources. Also, it shows a lack of

668
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:30.399
Abimereki Muzaale: reverence for predecessors. Yeah. Yeah. And and and academically, that's bad.

669
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:42.329
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, we we we I, people like took a plagiarism. I think figure is is a really bad time, because Cha. Gp has literally figure as a human race. Yeah, is that bad.

670
01:18:42.430 --> 01:19:03.750
Abimereki Muzaale: I think it's very good, for I just pop up. This is because, see? So but since of giving recognition to way of good information from. I guess that's what people refer to. Yeah, so absolutely plagiarize. But then it seems to be plagiarism, cause it didn't make.

671
01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:10.720
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you're going to have a checklist, at least give us a checklist that existed before, even if they didn't call it that.

672
01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:15.349
Abimereki Muzaale: and then tell us why you needed a variant.

673
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:18.380
Abimereki Muzaale: a variation which is nothing for music.

674
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:35.380
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm working on an an you know, Nunga Meyer variations, you know, and Nunga has been the theme of mine. 2023 so the speed of music, every melody. And II I'm learning from gospel music, University melody is the base of everything

675
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.380
Abimereki Muzaale: for every melody. You can change the chords.

676
01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:55.690
Abimereki Muzaale: of course. Yeah, this. Yeah, you can change the course. Now, the code that you can change to your used to the codes in the key of playing in it goes for music as like, oh, my goodness, you can change. You can use the code from any key as long as as long as that. Not is in that court.

677
01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:05.479
Abimereki Muzaale: Wow! The melody! That's why you like. Oh, you like that! That opened up by a while. But anyways, so check this

678
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:18.389
Abimereki Muzaale: use a checklist to frame everything you do from the abstract intro literature, review, discussion, and especially showing how this

679
01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:31.259
Abimereki Muzaale: something I could check this from that famous paper. And now, yeah, creating a variation that checklist more suited and explain. Explain to us, why is more suited to Uganda setting?

680
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:48.880
Abimereki Muzaale: And if you use the agent verb object stuff and introduce this to my last comment, introduced this very, Abby that Uganda would have been the agent, but because it outsourced that agency. It's a principle

681
01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:56.610
Abimereki Muzaale: that will invite because there's a there's a tokens big tokens and social sciences. Principal agent.

682
01:20:57.190 --> 01:21:01.889
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that it would just light up. That is, that is head of a catch fire.

683
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Now I get you to share with me

684
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:15.840
Patrick Muinda: these how to share this is very simple. I'm going to copy. So this is how you do charge it to you.

685
01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.679
Abimereki Muzaale: Let's see, let's make sure. So is it just this final one, or you are not here things

686
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:27.350
Patrick Muinda: just as we've been doing it. II want to systematically learn how you've

687
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:28.770
Patrick Muinda: from the beginning.

688
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:37.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, I think this is where we started right. What, how I'm going to do this is using. We're here. I'm going to create.

689
01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:50.200
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm good. Oh, oh, I see. I logged out. II looked into a different profile. Was that they? Okay. we get back here.

690
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:56.830
Abimereki Muzaale: I'd be kisser I'd be married.

691
01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:04.700
Abimereki Muzaale:  Abi. Kiss. Fine epicissa. P.

692
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:18.680
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay. So what I do this is a good opportunity to just get a little more land, a little more about charge Gp, so not charge Gp. Github

693
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:30.540
Abimereki Muzaale: that too many folders here I created them automatically, have a script which produced them on my computer and pushed them here. So don't worry about this, but adding, anything is very easy. So I just click, add file.

694
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:31.850
Patrick Muinda: Hmm!

695
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:45.869
Abimereki Muzaale: You could upload. But I'm going to create. Because I can copy and paste from charg be able to access this and what you share with me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So we're gonna call this

706
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:35.270
Abimereki Muzaale: Hash is one highest level with that. Then a double hush is the next level in terms of phone size.

707
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.750
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. Okay?

708
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.529

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.860
Abimereki Muzaale: almost done.

732
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:33.970
Hmm.

Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, this is be my I've really spent almost entire on Chat Gpg.

736
01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:08.340
Abimereki Muzaale: it just actual bewilderment, but not at least I have a bit understanding of how it was trained and how it works

737
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:10.950
Patrick Muinda: especially 3 semesters, so helpful.

738
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.760
Patrick Muinda: It's really helpful.

739
01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.210
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

740
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.920
This is so good.

741
01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.089
Abimereki Muzaale: This is, I'm so excited because of I've I've got it to understand that. So this is

742
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:26.860
Patrick Muinda: okay.

743
01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:28.280
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay.

744
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:36.440
Patrick Muinda: You know, II had got everything the other way around. I was really emphasizing

745
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:45.190
Patrick Muinda: my knowledge and understanding of what I'm doing, so so that when it's time for the presentation and defense I can.

746
01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:46.849
Patrick Muinda: But now I realize

747
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:50.950
Patrick Muinda: it should actually be. The other round. People should be able to understand from the topic

748
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:58.789
Abimereki Muzaale: exactly. Yes.

749
01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:00.230
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

750
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Especially those who won't have the

751
01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.320
Patrick Muinda: opportunity to sed through the defense.

752
01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:07.880
Abimereki Muzaale: Exactly.

753
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.400
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

754
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.499
Abimereki Muzaale: So I think if that's it. Yeah, that's it. So let's see what it looks like.

755
01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:17.120
Abimereki Muzaale: Commit. This is human.

756
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.600
Abimereki Muzaale: The committee is like, our

757
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.200
Abimereki Muzaale: subject to that

758
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:24.440
Patrick Muinda: reject

759
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:27.890
agent

760
01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.250
Abimereki Muzaale: object discussion.

761
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:32.220
Abimereki Muzaale: Be sure. Let us see you

762
01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:36.160
Abimereki Muzaale: checklist exactly.

763
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:49.279
Abimereki Muzaale: Documentation. So this is what it looks like.

764
01:27:49.300 --> 01:28:08.379
Patrick Muinda: very easy to to navigate. So you'll know that this is the first thing we did deal with. Let me share the screen, and I see if I can access.

765
01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:13.029
Patrick Muinda: So have you. Have you unshared? I've stopped sharing.

766
01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.230
Patrick Muinda: Okay?

767
01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:19.599
So let's see, let's see. Here.

768
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.130
Patrick Muinda:  are you seeing my screen now?

769
01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:33.210
Abimereki Muzaale: Not yet. But I think it's being loaded has started sharing screen. I don't know. I

770
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:34.519
Abimereki Muzaale: like a process.

771
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:37.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Well.

772
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:42.250
Abimereki Muzaale: do you have more than one screen open on your computer? Oh, there it is. It is.

773
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:44.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah.

774
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:48.230
Patrick Muinda: so

775
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.389
Patrick Muinda: so here we are.

776
01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:02.670
Patrick Muinda: Specific document. So you want to go to click on. P, so is the is the user name. But P is a repository. So P.

777
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:06.430
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, they're going to be. Yeah, that's a repository.

778
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.480
I see.

779
01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:24.730
Abimereki Muzaale: Why is it? Why is it just showing only one? It's showing, and you have push access.

780
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:30.579
Abimereki Muzaale: you can be kissed. P. Again.

781
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:33.320
Patrick Muinda: Yeah.

782
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:35.980
Abimereki Muzaale: I'm just supposed to see

783
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:39.229
Abimereki Muzaale: it seems it's not giving you access to everything.

784
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:45.910
Patrick Muinda: cause I noticed not able to navigate through.

785
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:50.350
Abimereki Muzaale: So you have access only to that. That's strange.

786
01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.840
Abimereki Muzaale: That is strange.

787
01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.799
Patrick Muinda: or maybe I logged in rumbling.

788
01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:06.770
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, no, I've the footage connects this something. Private means you have access. But you think you know they have access to this document.

789
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:09.150
Patrick Muinda: Oh, yeah, here here it is.

790
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.270
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, oh, click on that.

791
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Actually a view code. Maybe.

792
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.799
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, that's interesting.

793
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:29.619
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, you're not. You're you're looking at. Quote. You look at quote rather than move back mo, move, move back this move this hour. Back

794
01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:36.229
Abimereki Muzaale: our top left click on view. Code. Where where does that take you? II don't know.

795
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:41.289
Abimereki Muzaale: There it is. So it's view code these, everything.

796
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:46.060
Abimereki Muzaale: Everything is yeah, good. So it's checklist. Yes.

797
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.260
Abimereki Muzaale: you you haven't clicked in it, are you?

798
01:30:52.520 --> 01:31:02.149
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, it's opening here. You know our connections. I'm I'm at 300 MB per second. Yeah, you go

799
01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:09.759
Abimereki Muzaale: nice. Okay? So you have access. So you can see. So what I usually do. If you go to like one, go to one and see

800
01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:15.630
Abimereki Muzaale: I think I first paste copied and pasted, then I type notes.

801
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:20.970
Abimereki Muzaale: So I copy this. Go far down, and then I then I just wrote some notes at the end.

802
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:35.060
Abimereki Muzaale: let's see, hey, please, edit for grandma and clarity. Do not mess.

803
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:36.630
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. Cool

804
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:42.810
Abimereki Muzaale: and and I made some additional notes like, Go to act one. you see, at one.

805
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.759
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, I've done here.

806
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.599
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So on. Act 1 0.

807
01:31:53.380 --> 01:32:01.190
Abimereki Muzaale: You know you're doing. You're you're clicking on. The history stuff click on the folder. Go. Buck, yeah.

808
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:13.279
Abimereki Muzaale:  the folder click on click on the phone where the act one is actually actual. Act one. Yeah. There, then click on that again. I created so many soft folders

809
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:21.790
Abimereki Muzaale:  No, no, I have feedback on those 2 documents. Click on that first one, then you click on the second. Later.

810
01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:35.210
Abimereki Muzaale: you said 300 megabits per second. Yeah. Yeah. The last time I checked maybe higher than that.

811
01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:39.620
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, there's nothing here. There's nothing yet. Huh?

812
01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.460
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, move back. I thought I had made notes here.

813
01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.740
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, it may be under 0. Click! Try that one.

814
01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:53.309
Abimereki Muzaale: II really thought I'd read notes.

815
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.620
Abimereki Muzaale: No, there's no notes yet. This tray is up to 0.

816
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:06.340
Abimereki Muzaale: So click on P. P. And P.

817
01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:11.329
Abimereki Muzaale: Even here, even under files here. Yes, there.

818
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:24.490
Abimereki Muzaale: let's try to go. Oh, click view code. So so all this environment is developed for quote for programmers. We're we're using it for other reasons

819
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:30.179
Abimereki Muzaale: down here, down here. Let me do

820
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:34.449
Abimereki Muzaale: blue in blue here in the middle center. Oh, okay.

821
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:38.140
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, try act 0.

822
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:50.300
Abimereki Muzaale: So these are not this complex. It's me who created complex set act 0 0, who created a very complex setup

823
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:55.249
Abimereki Muzaale: up to 0 0. The subfolders

824
01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.420
Abimereki Muzaale: click on the first one, and I think you had a second nice feedback.

825
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:09.269
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes. So, as you can see, I just playing around feedback from this perspective.

826
01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:21.659
Abimereki Muzaale: I still exploring. Now, I don't need this anymore, even, probably. Yeah, yeah. So you don't need to. But but any, yeah. So I just wanted to be able to navigate that. But now let's

827
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:31.549
Abimereki Muzaale: adjust to the main click on P, and then there, you know, you'll be able to navigate to whatever you want on P. Or did you click, p, yeah.

828
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:37.510
Abimereki Muzaale: And so keeps taking you there. Click on view code.

829
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.649
Abimereki Muzaale: I wonder where it takes you. There view code view code.

830
01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:47.049
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So here you can access from here, you can access whatever you want. Really, it's checklist

831
01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:57.199
Abimereki Muzaale: analysis. So I think I'm so excited about the idea of a checklist

832
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.480
Abimereki Muzaale: because

833
01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.430
Abimereki Muzaale: or tokens, because that is what distinguishes a very mature

834
01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.470
area of engineering.

835
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Like aviation.

836
01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:14.429
Abimereki Muzaale: Very. It's contrasted with a

837
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:19.889
Abimereki Muzaale: less mature and like a qualitative study way of checking opinions of leaders.

838
01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:29.789
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's what you're doing. That's what you're doing in the Novo area. That's not like Sarah's doctor, thesis

839
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:40.299
Abimereki Muzaale: because microfinance but tagged, it was leaders in certain areas. So that's that's the the that's the

840
01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:57.220
Abimereki Muzaale: in terms of distance. That greatest distance in the sciences is from places where they have tokens. Yeah, literally check things that at an area where you're actually asking opinion, leaders tell you what they think is important.

841
01:35:57.250 --> 01:36:04.909
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, which will in 100 years become a checklist.

842
01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:11.370
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So if you can use that, the cause for any field to move forward

843
01:36:11.410 --> 01:36:25.829
Abimereki Muzaale: checklist pretty much, if not as use that language. You could be the first one said, using it, and said so so you could introduce the checklist

844
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:42.510
Abimereki Muzaale: and and you abstract. And in the introduction you could refer to, given a definition and check this and say, Oh, this is widely used in aviation in medicine, and you can save those papers I shared. I can. I can share the citation

845
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:54.309
Abimereki Muzaale: people be like. Oh, as long as you're not making up things people take you seriously. Yeah, you're like, Oh, you're widely read. You're saying aviation. You're saving medicine. And now you apply

846
01:36:54.430 --> 01:37:07.740
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, and they're like, so there's a checklist from America. But we're not just bringing it like, oh, nice. So writing a book called Indigenizing Social Work.

847
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:24.879
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, from America in the Uk. Do they apply to Uganda? So exactly is that checklist from those ends. What needs to be modified in that checklist to apply to Uganda? So that's what you're doing. And if that's in your first 3 part of somewhere you're done.

848
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.350
Patrick Muinda: Yeah. Your video. Please please show me those papers that introduce how to

849
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:44.130
Patrick Muinda: how to say that I'm not meeting. I'm not introducing that. Don't worry. I'm going to put them in the ripple. I don't need to do it now

850
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:53.250
Abimereki Muzaale: I would be up to in the zoom. Call this. This one paper from an is physiology an icu.

851
01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.510
Patrick Muinda: Okay?

852
01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:00.010
Abimereki Muzaale: And then there's one from surgery then. I will get one from aviation.

853
01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:05.440
Patrick Muinda: They use the word checklist in reference to

854
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:12.319
Abimereki Muzaale: literally so check this like for for surgery.

855
01:38:12.610 --> 01:38:20.849
Abimereki Muzaale: Before you said surgery. You're supposed to count the number of rugs, rugs, or what's used to soap blood as you go with a head, I know, so that

856
01:38:21.230 --> 01:38:23.129
Abimereki Muzaale: so you can count those things.

857
01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:25.189
Abimereki Muzaale: Vanessa's

858
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:30.000
Abimereki Muzaale: and it's surgeons. Then you do the surgeon in before you close up the patients.

859
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:38.869
Patrick Muinda: Yeah, people, bodies.

860
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:53.039
Abimereki Muzaale: Yes, that's outrageous. Well, after 3 h of the struggle goes on, that can happen totally happen. Checklist really protects the surgeon

861
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.389
Patrick Muinda: from America. That's the best way to get a little suit and to lose, you know, all the money of, and in your life

862
01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:09.259
Abimereki Muzaale: so this is a real but but but even in your area. That's very powerful way of communicating

863
01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:19.339
Abimereki Muzaale: what agents should is expected to do, or you desire them to do, and most important, in my opinion, is to clarify

864
01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.590
Abimereki Muzaale: that you're not inventive at will.

865
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:26.019
Abimereki Muzaale: This has been done in America, and you're giving us a Ugandan flavor.

866
01:39:26.170 --> 01:39:27.890
Abimereki Muzaale: Why

867
01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:36.709
Abimereki Muzaale: why not? Just because you always suffering country. No, no, no, that's very reason more compelling than you guys different.

868
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:55.490
Abimereki Muzaale: So so yeah, III can tell you that will guide took over. Yeah, that's true. From the beginning to the end.

869
01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:58.820
Abimereki Muzaale: To understand this, to understand that. Yeah.

870
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.209
Now, what I need to do is unpack all that we've said in the last

871
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:07.320
Patrick Muinda: 4 h, 3 h hours or so.

872
01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:12.069
Abimereki Muzaale: Home investment? Yes, it's it's not.

873
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:23.809
Patrick Muinda: It's okay. 3 h. Yeah. So I'm going to slowly by slowly. Take this in, please share with me this recording as well. And those.

874
01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:28.880
Abimereki Muzaale: So you're gonna find everything. So you're gonna find the link to the recording.

875
01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:44.940
Abimereki Muzaale: And the papers everything is going to be in I'll just send you whatsapp just letting you know I'll put it in. Let's say I can have access to because she gets excited by things.

876
01:40:45.150 --> 01:40:49.410
Patrick Muinda: Okay. But now, if you're gonna put in Spd. How am I going to get it?

877
01:40:50.050 --> 01:41:06.890
Abimereki Muzaale: No, no, no, no! Now this is, if you have developed your own, your own repository. That's fine. This one is just for us

878
01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:11.740
Abimereki Muzaale: to discuss. Have your own ripple

879
01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.000
Abimereki Muzaale: while you're doing stuff. Yeah.

880
01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.749
Patrick Muinda: okay, thank you so much for a very good night. I hope you don't have a very alimony.

881
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.450
Abimereki Muzaale: It's Sunday.

882
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:26.089
Abimereki Muzaale: there's no, there's no church service that favour him.

883
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:31.840
Abimereki Muzaale: Alright! Have a nice day
