      - **Agent**: It's a bit implicit, but the agent is likely the "Technical, Vocational Education and Training Institutions in Uganda." These are the entities that would be undergoing or implementing the digital transformation.
  
      - **Verb**: The verb is also not directly stated but implied. The action happening here is the development or application of a "Framework for Digital Transformation." So, the verb could be understood as "applying" or "developing."

      - **Object**: The object in this context is the "Framework for Digital Transformation." This is what the thesis aims to deliver or elucidate.
