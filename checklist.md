In today's ever-evolving global educational landscape, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, serving as government representatives, acknowledge the pivotal role of digital technology in advancing skill delivery. This recognition transcends borders, extending its influence to various developing economies worldwide. However, the pervasive failure of digital transformation projects casts a formidable and multi-faceted shadow over these endeavors. These projects grapple with an alarming 70% failure rate, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the very existence of the organizations that embark on them (Djurovic, 2020). The financial ramifications are staggering, with an unsettling 9.9% wastage rate for every dollar invested, equivalent to UGX 9.9 million squandered for every UGX 1 billion expended.
The relentless prevalence of digital transformation project failures in regions like Uganda spotlights a core predicament: the absence of robust IT governance. The responsibility largely rests with the upper levels of Ministry of Education management, who entrust project implementation to designated agent teams in projects. A pivotal driver behind these failures is the inherent deficiency in process quality, which surfaces as a central impediment to achieving project success in digital transformation endeavors (CHAOS, 2020; Rohn, 2022).
Conventional solutions, including established frameworks, have proven ineffectual in addressing this enduring challenge. In response, this study has culminated in the creation of a "Framework for Improved Digital Transformation Projects," meticulously tailored to the unique operational landscape of TVET institutions in Uganda. This framework aspires to proactively counteract the mounting challenge of project failures within the dynamic TVET environments, nurturing the conditions conducive to successful digital transformation outcomes (UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2022).
To realize this overarching objective, this study has defined specific goals, including discerning the prerequisites for a successful digital transformation framework in Ugandan TVETs, formulating a framework conducive to digital transformation in these institutions, and evaluating the efficacy of the designed framework.

In today's rapidly changing global educational environment, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, acting as representatives of governments, recognize the crucial role digital technology plays in enhancing skill delivery. This acknowledgment is universal, reaching many developing economies around the world. However, the widespread failure of digital transformation projects poses significant challenges. An astounding 70% of these projects do not succeed, jeopardizing the future of organizations that initiate them (Djurovic, 2020). The financial implications are alarming; for every dollar invested, there's a 9.9% waste, meaning UGX 9.9 million is lost for every UGX 1 billion spent.

The consistent rate of digital transformation project failures in places like Uganda emphasizes a fundamental issue: the lack of strong IT governance. The onus largely falls on senior Ministry of Education management who delegate project implementation to specific agent teams. One primary reason for these failures is the inherent lack of quality in processes, which emerges as a significant barrier to digital transformation project success (CHAOS, 2020; Rohn, 2022).

Traditional solutions, including well-known frameworks, have failed to address this persistent problem. As a solution, this study introduces a "Framework for Improved Digital Transformation Projects," specifically tailored to TVET institutions in Uganda. This framework aims to preemptively tackle the rising challenge of project failures, fostering an environment favorable to successful digital transformations (UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2022).

This study sets clear goals: to identify the prerequisites for a successful digital transformation framework in Ugandan TVETs, to develop a framework suited for digital transformation in these institutions, and to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

An in-depth literature review within this thesis explores IT governance, challenges of digital transformation, and the shifting rates of digital transformation failures—decreasing from 70% to 66% in developed countries but increasing in developing nations. The study bases its approach on several theories, including agency theory, dynamic capabilities theory, and Delone & McLean theory.

Using a mixed-method approach, which involves sequential explanatory mixed methods, SPSS for quantitative data, NVivo for qualitative data, thematic analysis, and partial least squares structured equation modeling for factor analysis, this research provides a comprehensive methodology.

The results section highlights the crucial role of process quality in determining the success of digital transformation projects. An extensive analysis shows positive responses across seven latent variables, emphasizing the importance of factors like goal conflict, communication, task programmability, contract type, and digital transformation. Reliability tests in this study further confirm the consistency of these variables.

In summary, this research stresses the significance of process quality in ensuring successful digital transformation. As technology evolves, achieving success in digital transformation projects within Ugandan TVET institutions becomes paramount. This work offers insights into leveraging process quality to influence successful digital transformations, considering the unique context of TVET institutions, and paves the way for improved project outcomes. Emphasizing process quality can enhance communication strategies, resolve goal conflicts, improve task programmability, and reduce inefficiencies—key elements in digital transformation.
