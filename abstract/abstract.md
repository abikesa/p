In today's ever-evolving global educational landscape, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, serving as government representatives, acknowledge the pivotal role of digital technology in advancing skill delivery. This recognition transcends borders, extending its influence to various developing economies worldwide. However, the pervasive failure of digital transformation projects casts a formidable and multi-faceted shadow over these endeavors. These projects grapple with an alarming 70% failure rate, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the very existence of the organizations that embark on them (Djurovic, 2020). The financial ramifications are staggering, with an unsettling 9.9% wastage rate for every dollar invested, equivalent to UGX 9.9 million squandered for every UGX 1 billion expended.

The relentless prevalence of digital transformation project failures in regions like Uganda spotlights a core predicament: the absence of robust IT governance. The responsibility largely rests with the upper levels of Ministry of Education management, who entrust project implementation to designated agent teams in projects. A pivotal driver behind these failures is the inherent deficiency in process quality, which surfaces as a central impediment to achieving project success in digital transformation endeavors (CHAOS, 2020; Rohn, 2022).

Conventional solutions, including established frameworks, have proven ineffectual in addressing this enduring challenge. In response, this study has culminated in the creation of a "Framework for Improved Digital Transformation Projects," meticulously tailored to the unique operational landscape of TVET institutions in Uganda. This framework aspires to proactively counteract the mounting challenge of project failures within the dynamic TVET environments, nurturing the conditions conducive to successful digital transformation outcomes (UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2022).

To realize this overarching objective, this study has defined specific goals, including discerning the prerequisites for a successful digital transformation framework in Ugandan TVETs, formulating a framework conducive to digital transformation in these institutions, and evaluating the efficacy of the designed framework.

This thesis encompasses an exhaustive literature review that digs into the domain of information technology governance, the predicaments and realities of digital transformation, and the evolving trend of digital transformation failure, declining from 70% to 66% in developed economies while intensifying in the developing world. This study has identified and incorporated theories such as agency theory, dynamic capabilities theory, and Delone & McLean theory as the foundational underpinnings of this study.

By employing a mixed-method approach, encompassing sequential explanatory mixed methods, SPSS for quantitative data analysis, NVivo for qualitative analysis, thematic analysis, and partial least squares structured equation modelling for factor analysis, this methodology furnishes a robust framework for this research.

As this study unfolds its results section, the findings reveal that process quality plays an instrumental role in amplifying the success of digital transformation. The comprehensive analysis reflects positive responses to indicators across seven latent variables, revealing the critical significance of elements such as goal conflict, communication, task programmability, contract type, and digital transformation. The reliability tests in this study have duly affirmed the dependability of these variables.

In conclusion, this study underscores the profound importance of process quality in achieving successful digital transformation. As the technological landscape continues its rapid evolution, securing success in digital transformation projects within Ugandan TVET institutions assumes unprecedented significance. This research presents a unique perspective on enhancing the influence of process quality on digital transformation success, bearing in mind the distinctive context of these institutions and ushering in prospects for more favorable project outcomes. Recognizing the role of process quality can refine communication protocols, address goal conflicts, enhance task programmability, and mitigate shirking behaviorâ€”vital facets in the execution of digital transformation.

ChatGPT:

Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions globally have recognized the importance of digital technology in enhancing skill delivery. This recognition has penetrated developing economies, but the digital transformation in regions like Uganda faces a staggering 70% failure rate (Djurovic, 2020). One major contributor to these failures is the lack of robust IT governance, often due to poor process quality (CHAOS, 2020; Rohn, 2022). 

Traditional solutions have been ineffective, prompting this study to develop a "Framework for Improved Digital Transformation Projects" tailored for Ugandan TVET institutions. The research goals included identifying success prerequisites for digital transformation in Ugandan TVETs, formulating a framework for these institutions, and evaluating its efficacy. Through an extensive literature review and leveraging theories like agency theory and Delone & McLean theory, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of IT governance and the trends in digital transformation failures.

Utilizing a mixed-method approach with tools like SPSS and NVivo, the findings spotlight process quality as crucial for digital transformation success. Analysis revealed key factors such as goal conflict, communication, and task programmability as influential elements. 

In essence, this research emphasizes the role of process quality in successful digital transformation within Ugandan TVET institutions. By focusing on process quality, institutions can enhance communication, address goal conflicts, and ensure better digital transformation outcomes.
