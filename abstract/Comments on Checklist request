D, good morning!  I am trying this exciting approach to document organisation and versioning.  Please let me know.  How do I make a comment write after an article?  For instance, I loved the article on the checklist by the surgeon who likened the intensive care work to attempting to fly the B-17 from memory alone. Could you guide me?
