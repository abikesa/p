# 1. GPT help

```
I've received an email from my brother, who is doing a PhD. he c.c.d 7 other folks, can recognize another brother. but the rest are strangers. here's the email: Dear Reviewer,

Please receive the PPT for expert validation of the model that I have shared with you.  I kindly seek your expert review of the functionality of the prototype and how it aligns with the developed model in my research.

I greatly appreciate your input in this and for the time you have put in.  Please alert me if you need me to give you a call to provide furhter clarity before you proceed to complete the short survey I have sent to you.

Regards,

Patrick.. a PPT is attached. shortly after received another email from my brother but using a different email account: Having trouble viewing or submitting this form?

I have invited you, as an expert in the field of Research, Planning, Statistics, Monitoring and Evaluation to evaluate and review the Model I have developed from my PhD Research. Please let me know if you need me to call you and provide further clarification if you need me to do so. I will greatly appreciate your input and comments if you are able to contribute to the improvement of this model.
Expert Validation of Digital Transformation Model (SDTP) Developed using PLS-SEM
Dear Participants,

Thank you for joining in this valuable exercise aimed at gathering your insights and feedback on this newly crafted simulator, particularly its alignment with the developed model. Your perspectives are crucial in enhancing the effectiveness and relevance of the Model for Digital Transformation.

Instructions:

For each of the short statements, please indicate your level of agreement or disagreement using the provided Likert scale.
Choose the response that best reflects your opinion:
Strongly Disagree
Disagree
Neutral
Agree
Strongly Agree
Objective: The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate how well the demonstrated simulator aligns with the developed model and how well the simulator helps to predict digital transformation outcomes based on the models tested in this research. Your honest and thoughtful feedback will guide us in making improvements to better meet the needs of the users of the model crafted through this research.

I've alerted him about my confusion since I wasn't expecting anything from him... but am aware of his thesis topic. not sure the other folks are also confused. in fact, I thought I was blind c.c.d, until he alerted me in a separate whatsApp. Anyways, I'm uploading a .PDF version of the .PPT, and a few notes I'm still writing, since he asked for my feedback... noted that I might be confused. here's my feedback: # 1. Received two emails 
- patrickmuinda@gmail.com
- muinda@yahoo.com
- `Ambiguity` and a little confusion as to whether they were duplicates
- Some sort of warning to expect two seperate communications would help
- Wasn't expecting in emails from you regarding an "expert review"
- Didn't know i was an expert :)

# 2. First email
- Was about expert validation of digital transformation model developed using PLS-SEM
- Since I was at work, I thought I'll study this in the evening or over the weekend

# 3. Second email
- Dear reviewer, ...
- Because the first email called me an expert and this one a reviewer my confusion was sustained
- Email says there's an attached PPT for expert validation
- For a second I was wondering what PPT stands for (I'm transitioned away from office suite)
- Would help to be warned not only about the two emails but also about how long this process might take of our time
- Assure me also that I'm an expert and can review otherwise I feel like an imposter

# 4. Downloaded PPT
- Converted to .PDF
- Realized its 30 pages
- Quick review tells me some slides have way too much info
- Usually a readable slide has about 3 bullet points in 24 size font
- My personal preference is for `plain white slides` that do not distract
- Since the slides have a lot of content I know I don't have time to review during work hours
- And so I'm going to upload .PDF to GPT-4 and see if it can summarize
- Will also include the email verbiage you sent. can you summarize the .PDF? does it make any sense? and can you propose an email he might resend to the others to avoid my confusion?
