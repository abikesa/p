   - 0.1. Received two emails 
      - patrickmuinda@gmail.com
      - muinda@yahoo.com
      - `Ambiguity` and a little confusion as to whether they were duplicates
      - Some sort of warning to expect two seperate communications would help
      - Wasn't expecting in emails from you regarding an "expert review"
      - Didn't know i was an expert :)

   - 0.2. First email
      - Was about expert validation of digital transformation model developed using PLS-SEM
      - Since I was at work, I thought I'll study this in the evening or over the weekend

   - 0.3. Second email
      - Dear reviewer, ...
      - Because the first email called me an expert and this one a reviewer my confusion was sustained
      - Email says there's an attached PPT for expert validation
      - For a second I was wondering what PPT stands for (I'm transitioned away from office suite)
      - Would help to be warned not only about the two emails but also about how long this process might take of our time
      - Assure me also that I'm an expert and can review otherwise I feel like an imposter

   - 0.4. Downloaded PPT
      - Converted to .PDF
      - Realized its 30 pages
      - Quick review tells me some slides have way too much info
      - Usually a readable slide has about 3 bullet points in 24 size font
      - My personal preference is for `plain white slides` that do not distract
      - Since the slides have a lot of content I know I don't have time to review during work hours
      - And so I'm going to upload .PDF to GPT-4 and see if it can summarize
      - Will also include the email verbiage you sent. can you summarize the .PDF? does it make any sense? and can you propose an email he might resend to the others to avoid my confusion?

I've received an email from my brother, who is doing a PhD. he c.c.d 7 other folks, can recognize another brother. but the rest are strangers. here's the email: Dear Reviewer,

Please receive the PPT for expert validation of the model that I have shared with you.  I kindly seek your expert review of the functionality of the prototype and how it aligns with the developed model in my research.

I greatly appreciate your input in this and for the time you have put in.  Please alert me if you need me to give you a call to provide furhter clarity before you proceed to complete the short survey I have sent to you.

Regards,

Patrick.. a PPT is attached. shortly after received another email from my brother but using a different email account: Having trouble viewing or submitting this form?

# 2. First Iteration

The presentation outlines a comprehensive study aimed at enhancing the success rate of digital transformation projects within Ugandan Technical Vocational Education and Training Institutions (TVETs). It details the research problem of high failure rates in digital transformation, sets specific objectives for the study, and elaborates on the theoretical framework utilizing Agency Theory, DeLone and McLean Theory, and Dynamic Capabilities Theory. The methodology includes a mix of positivism, interpretivism, and pragmatism, with data collection through questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. The study proposes a model tailored for the Ugandan context, highlighting the importance of process quality, goal conflict, communication, and task programmability. The findings support the model's applicability, offering practical implications for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers, alongside recommendations for future research.

For your brother's communication with the other reviewers, a more streamlined email could clarify the intent, process, and expectations. Here's a proposed version:
